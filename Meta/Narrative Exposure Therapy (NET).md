# 🧵 Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET)

**Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET)** is a short-term, structured therapeutic approach for processing **complex and cumulative trauma** through **autobiographical storytelling**. It is often used with survivors of **war, abuse, displacement, or multiple traumatic events**, and helps integrate fragmented memories into a **coherent narrative identity**.

NET blends exposure-based techniques with **trauma-informed narrative reconstruction**, helping clients reduce distress while reclaiming authorship of their life story.

> “The aim is to reweave trauma into the self—not erase it.”

## 🧠 Core Principles

| Principle                        | Description                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Exposure**                     | Revisiting traumatic memories within a safe, structured narrative         |
| **Lifeline Construction**        | Mapping key life events along a symbolic timeline (rope, stones, flowers) |
| **Autobiographical Integration** | Trauma is placed in context, reducing its intrusive power                 |
| **Testimony Creation**           | Written narratives can be shared or ritualized to reclaim voice and truth |
| **Stabilization First**          | Emotional and somatic regulation precedes deep memory work                |

## 🛠 Process Stages

1. **Assessment & Stabilization**
   - Grounding tools, affect regulation, safety planning
2. **Lifeline Mapping**
   - Tangible or visual timeline of events (positive, neutral, traumatic)
3. **Narrative Exposure**
   - Recounting events in detail, linking sensory/emotional/relational data
4. **Integration & Closure**
   - Writing, witnessing, or symbolizing the story; reaffirming strengths and coherence

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques

- Rope with objects (flowers = good, stones = traumatic)
- Therapist as non-directive witness
- Written or spoken testimony
- Psychoeducation on trauma memory and nervous system
- Grounding interludes (pendulation)

---

## ⚠️ Ethical and Cultural Considerations

- **Cultural Framing**: Stories may include spiritual or ancestral elements
- **Testimony Risk**: Revisiting trauma must not reproduce harm or exposure
- **Community Healing**: Can be adapted for collective witnessing or social justice
- **Not for Active Crisis**: Requires emotional stability before trauma narration

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- What story have I been carrying alone?
- What parts of my past still feel like they don’t “fit” into who I am now?
- Who would I want to witness my truth?
- What events in my life deserve flowers—not just stones?
