# 📖 Vault Guidelines

This vault is organized to support **relational analysis, reflective practice, and educational reference**.

---

## 🗂 Folder Structure

- **Frameworks:** Theory notes and models for reference.
- **Prompts:** Structured analysis and reflection prompts.
- **Templates:** Reusable structures for reflection, analysis, and note-taking.
- **References:** Collected insights, reading lists, and external resources.
- **Meta:** Guidelines, tagging conventions, and vault design notes.

---

## 🏷 Tagging Conventions

- `framework` → Used for theory/framework notes.
- `prompt` → Used for structured prompts.
- `template` → Used for reusable note structures.
- `reference` → Used for external resources and curated content.
- `meta` → Used for vault structure, guidelines, and index files.

---

## 🔗 Linking Conventions

- Always link frameworks with [[Vault Guide]].
- Prompts should reference frameworks explicitly.
- Use **bidirectional linking** whenever possible.

---

## ✨ Best Practices

- Keep notes short, clear, and modular.
- Prefer linking to duplicating information.
- Use frontmatter consistently for search, queries, and plugins.
- When adding new frameworks or prompts, copy from the template files.
