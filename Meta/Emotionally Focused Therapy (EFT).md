# 💞 Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)

**Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)** is a structured, evidence-based model for couples and relational systems developed by Dr. Sue Johnson. It’s grounded in **attachment theory** and focuses on reshaping emotional bonding through **attunement, vulnerability, and repair**.

EFT views conflict not as the problem—but as a signal of **unmet attachment needs** and **disconnection distress**.

## 🔁 The EFT Cycle: Identify → Access → Restructure

1. **Identify the negative cycle** (pursue/withdraw, criticize/defend, etc.).
2. **Access and name primary emotions** under protective strategies (e.g., fear, hurt, longing).
3. **Restructure interactions** through new emotional disclosures and responsive repair.

---

## 💔 Common Negative Cycles

- **Pursuer / Withdrawer**: One partner protests disconnection while the other shuts down.
- **Blamer / Defender**: Criticism leads to defensiveness, creating escalation or shutdown.
- **Mutual Avoidance**: Both suppress emotion and disconnect to avoid conflict.

---

## ❤️ Key EFT Concepts

- **Attachment Needs**: To feel safe, seen, soothed, and supported in connection.
- **Primary vs Secondary Emotions**:
  - Primary: raw, vulnerable (e.g., fear, sadness).
  - Secondary: protective (e.g., anger, sarcasm, numbness).
- **Softening**: Vulnerability as a bridge to reconnection.
- **Engagement**: Turning toward and showing care in moments of distress.

## 🧠 Nervous System & Trauma Lens

- Emphasizes **co-regulation** and **felt safety** in emotional risk.
- Recognizes protective behaviors (shutdown, attack) as trauma-informed adaptations.
- EFT can soften **protective parts** (see [[IFS]]) by building trust in safe responsiveness.

---

## 🛠 EFT Practices in Relationships

- Use **emotion naming** to access soft emotions: “Underneath my anger, I feel alone.”
- Interrupt cycles: “This feels like our stuck pattern—is that what's happening?”
- Practice repair: “When I pulled away, it wasn’t about you—I was scared.”
- Offer reassurance: “I’m here. I want us to feel close again.”

## 🔄 Integration with Other Frameworks

- Deeply complements [[Attachment Theory]] and [[IFS]] (especially protector/exile dynamics).
- Supports repair in [[Consent Culture]] and trauma-informed boundary models.
- Can precede or integrate with [[Gottman Method]] and [[NVC]] for repair and scripts.

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- What’s the emotion I don’t usually show in conflict?
- What’s the dance we do when things get hard?
- What do I long for most in this relationship—and what makes it hard to ask?
- What would it feel like to risk softening instead of protecting?
