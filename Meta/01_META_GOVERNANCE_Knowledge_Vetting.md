# ðŸ”„ Meta-Prompt - Knowledge Integration & Bias Check

> **Task:** Define the protocol for vetting and integrating _new_ psychological frameworks (those not yet in the vault). The system must screen the new framework for potential **relational bias**, **mononormative assumptions**, and **pathologizing language** before allowing its content to be processed by the **[[Utility Prompt - Framework Content Generator]]**.

---

### ðŸ’» Vetting Protocol

1.  **Relational Bias Check:** Analyze the framework's core concepts. Does it primarily focus on **individual pathology** (e.g., 'fixing' one person) or **systemic/dyadic interaction** (e.g., understanding the cycle)? **Constraint:** If individualistic, the prompt must explicitly define how to shift its application to a relational lens.
2.  **Mononormative Bias Check:** Screen for language or assumptions that implicitly prioritize **monogamy** or **nuclear family structures**. **Constraint:** If such bias is found, the **[[Utility Prompt - Framework Content Generator]]** must include a mandatory section detailing "Non-Monogamy and Non-Traditional Structure Considerations."
3.  **Pathologizing Check:** Identify any concepts that could be used to label or blame a client's trauma response or non-normative identity (e.g., Kink, Neurodivergence). **Constraint:** Any such term must be flagged and replaced with a **[[Nonviolent_Communication_NVC]]** or **IFS**-aligned, non-judgmental description of the underlying need or protective Part.
4.  **Integration Mapping:** Confirm that the framework's terminology can be successfully mapped to the vault's core concepts (IFS, PVT, Attachment). If mapping fails, the framework is rejected or flagged for manual review.

### ðŸš¨ Final Action

If the framework passes the Vetting Protocol, the system is cleared to use the **[[Utility Prompt - Framework Content Generator]]** to create the final, vetted file. If the protocol fails, the system must generate a report detailing the specific ethical concerns and reject the framework.

This final meta-prompt acts as a **gatekeeper**, ensuring the continuous growth of the knowledge base is ethical, trauma-informed, and structurally sound.
