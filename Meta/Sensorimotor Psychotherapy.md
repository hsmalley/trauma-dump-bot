# 🌀 Sensorimotor Psychotherapy

**Sensorimotor Psychotherapy**, developed by **Pat Ogden**, is a body-centered therapeutic approach that integrates **somatic awareness with emotional and cognitive processing**, especially for trauma and attachment-related wounds. It emphasizes that trauma is stored not just in thoughts, but in **bodily patterns, posture, and procedural memory**.

> “The body remembers what the mind forgets.”

## 🧠 Core Principles

- **Bottom-Up Processing**: Healing begins in the body before language or insight.
- **Procedural Memory**: Trauma lives in reflexes, posture, and movement—not just explicit memories.
- **Window of Tolerance**: Emotional regulation is central; work happens within a manageable range.
- **Parts Integration**: Inner parts may express through physical tension, collapse, or action impulses.

## 🔍 Key Concepts

| Concept                  | Description                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Somatic Resources**    | Postures or movements that evoke safety, strength, or containment.           |
| **Action Tendencies**    | Incomplete defensive responses (e.g., a blocked impulse to push away).       |
| **Body Narrative**       | What the body says through habits, gestures, and tension.                    |
| **Contact & Connection** | Eye gaze, voice tone, posture—all used to support regulation and attunement. |

## 🛠 Techniques & Practices

- **Tracking**: Attuning to body sensations, breath, micro-movements during conversation.
- **Movement Experiments**: Exploring safe, embodied alternatives (e.g., pushing, standing tall).
- **Pendulation**: Gently moving between activation and regulation to process trauma safely.
- **Anchoring**: Establishing embodied safety cues before diving into trauma material.

---

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- What’s happening in my body right now as I speak or remember?
- Are there movements I want to make—but stop myself from making?
- What does “strength” or “softness” feel like somatically?
- Where do I hold tension—and what might it be trying to say?

## 🔄 Integration with Other Frameworks

- [[Polyvagal Theory (PVT)]] — shared focus on nervous system states and regulation
- [[Internal Family Systems (IFS)]] — body as access point for parts
- [[Trauma-Informed Care]] — pacing, containment, and consent-centered
- [[Somatic Experiencing]] — overlaps in trauma processing through body cues

---

## ⚠️ Relational Considerations

- **Touch** is not typically used—focus is on nonverbal cues and movement.
- Therapist acts as **co-regulator**, using body language and pacing to support safety.
- Shame, dissociation, and shutdown are tracked **physiologically**, not just cognitively.
