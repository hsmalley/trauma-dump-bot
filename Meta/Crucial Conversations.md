# 🗣️ Crucial Conversations

**Crucial Conversations** is a framework developed by Patterson, Grenny, McMillan, and Switzler for navigating **emotionally charged, high-stakes conversations** where opinions differ and outcomes matter. These tools support emotional regulation, mutual understanding, and collaborative problem-solving.

> “When stakes are high, opinions vary, and emotions run strong—_that’s_ a crucial conversation.”

| **State My Path**         | Share your perspective clearly and respectfully (facts → story → feeling → want) |
| **Make It Safe**          | Use contrast and mutual purpose to reduce defensiveness                          |
