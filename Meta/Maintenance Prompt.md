# 🧭 Vault Maintenance Prompt (Interactive)

You are stewarding the _Relational Analysis Vault_. Use this prompt to reflect, prioritize, or automate your next steps.

> **Current focus:** Structural integrity, tagging hygiene, and utility readiness.

## ☑️ Where to Begin?

Choose one to start with:

- Audit tag consistency: orphaned, duplicated, or mismatched tags
- Validate framework cross-links (e.g., NVC ↔ IFS ↔ Consent Culture)
- Review reflection prompts in examples—are they linked to active frameworks?

---

## 🔄 Reflective Questions

- What needs archiving, renaming, or refactoring?
- Which tools are stale or undocumented?
- What would I hand off to a collaborator? What needs me?
