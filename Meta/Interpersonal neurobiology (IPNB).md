# ðŸ§  Interpersonal Neurobiology (IPNB)

**Interpersonal Neurobiology (IPNB)** is an interdisciplinary framework developed by Dr. Dan Siegel. It synthesizes findings from neuroscience, psychology, sociology, and systems theory to explain how relationships and the brain interact to shape human experience. IPNB focuses on **integration**â€”the linking of differentiated partsâ€”as the foundation for mental well-being.

## ðŸ”‘ Core Concepts

- **Integration**: Well-being arises from integrationâ€”differentiating parts of a system and linking them harmoniously (brain regions, mind-body, relationships, etc.).
- **The Triangle of Well-being**: Mind, brain, and relationships are dynamically interwoven and influence each other.
- **Mindsight**: The capacity to perceive and reflect on one's own mind and the minds of others; a key to self-awareness and empathy.
- **Window of Tolerance**: Healthy regulation occurs when individuals operate within their optimal arousal zone; trauma or dysregulation can shrink this window.
- **Neuroplasticity**: Relationships and reflection can rewire the brain; change is possible at any age.

## ðŸ§© Applications in Relationships

- **Attunement & Co-regulation**: Secure relationships foster neural integration and resilience through emotional attunement and mutual regulation.
- **Repair after Rupture**: Emphasizes the healing power of repair processes on both interpersonal and neurological levels.
- **Reflective Functioning**: Encourages cultivating an observing self to navigate reactivity and foster deeper connection.

## ðŸ§  Nervous System Lens

- Draws on Polyvagal Theory: Emphasizes the social engagement system and how relationships shape autonomic states.
- Connects with trauma theory: Chronic misattunement or relational harm can disrupt integration and widen the gap between mental and neural coherence.

## ðŸ”„ Integration with Other Frameworks

- Complements **Attachment Theory** (relational wiring).
- Extends **Polyvagal Theory** with narrative and relational layers.
- Reinforces **Internal Family Systems (IFS)** by highlighting the role of integration across internal parts and external relationships.

## ðŸ›  Prompts for Reflection

- What helps you return to your window of tolerance in connection with others?
- How do you notice integration or fragmentation in your emotional responses?
- Where do you feel seen, soothed, safe, and secure in your relationships?
- What patterns in your relationships mirror your early neural wiring?
