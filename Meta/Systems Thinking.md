# 🔄 Systems Thinking

**Systems Thinking** is a framework for understanding how individual experiences and behaviors are shaped by **larger patterns, feedback loops, and contexts**. It moves beyond linear cause-and-effect to ask: _How do parts influence each other within a whole?_

Originally rooted in ecology, biology, and organizational theory, Systems Thinking now informs **family therapy, social justice work, trauma healing**, and complex relational analysis.

## 🧩 Core Principles

### 1. **Everything Exists in a System**

- People are embedded in multiple systems: family, culture, work, history, identity, body.
- Change in one part affects the whole.

### 2. **Patterns > Events**

- Focuses on **repeating dynamics** over isolated incidents.
- Asks: “What pattern is this part of?” rather than “Who caused this?”

### 3. **Feedback Loops**

- Reinforcing loops amplify a dynamic (e.g., escalation).
- Balancing loops stabilize or suppress change (e.g., guilt-shutdown-withdraw-repeat).

### 4. **Boundaries & Roles**

- Systems rely on roles (e.g., scapegoat, peacekeeper, hero) and boundaries.
- Who is allowed to feel, speak, need, or shift?

## 🧠 Applications in Relational Work

- **Identify Relational Roles**: Who consistently over-functions or under-functions?
- **Map Cycles**: What happens _before_, _during_, and _after_ a rupture?
- **Zoom Out**: What broader system (e.g., cultural, family, identity) is influencing this behavior?
- **Distinguish Person from Pattern**: "This isn’t just you—it’s something we're caught in."

## 🔍 Systems Thinking in Practice

- Use genograms, role maps, or timeline arcs to visualize multi-layered systems.
- Identify “attractors” (roles, traumas, norms) that keep dynamics in place.
- Introduce “perturbations” (new behaviors, insights) to shift the system.

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- What cycles or feedback loops do I see repeating in this relationship?
- What role do I often end up in—and how is that reinforced?
- What system (family, identity, culture) shaped my sense of safety, voice, or belonging?
- What small change might ripple outward through the system?
