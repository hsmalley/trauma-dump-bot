# 🪞 Radical Candor

**Radical Candor** is a communication framework developed by Kim Scott that encourages **clear, honest feedback** grounded in **genuine care for the other person**. It is especially used in leadership, mentorship, and close personal relationships to support **growth, accountability, and trust**.

> “Care personally. Challenge directly.”

## 🧠 Core Quadrants

| Axis                   | Description                                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Care Personally**    | Show empathy, emotional investment, and respect for the whole person |
| **Challenge Directly** | Be clear, assertive, and honest—even when it’s uncomfortable         |

These form four communication styles:

| Quadrant                     | Style                         | Traits                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Radical Candor**           | ✅ High Care + High Challenge | Honest, direct, respectful               |
| **Ruinous Empathy**          | 😬 High Care + Low Challenge  | Avoiding truth to protect feelings       |
| **Obnoxious Aggression**     | 😡 Low Care + High Challenge  | Brutal honesty without regard for impact |
| **Manipulative Insincerity** | 😈 Low Care + Low Challenge   | Passive, two-faced, unclear motives      |

## 🛠 Communication Tools

- **Situation-Behavior-Impact (SBI)**: Describe what happened, the behavior, and how it landed
- **Ask-Offer-Invite**: Offer feedback, then invite theirs
- **Gauge receptivity**: Pay attention to body cues, tone, and consent
- **Feedback is a gift**: Frame it as support, not punishment

---

## 💡 When to Use

- Giving tough feedback or making a boundary
- Encouraging growth in peers, partners, or collaborators
- Calling in behavior that affects trust, safety, or connection
- Debriefing misattunements in emotionally close relationships

---

## ⚠️ Watch For

- **Tone-Body mismatch**: Saying you “care” while acting cold or distant
- **Performative “honesty”**: Using the model to justify control, cruelty, or moralizing
- **Emotional bypassing**: Avoiding your own discomfort by focusing on their flaws

---

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- Am I balancing **truth with care**, or defaulting to one?
- Have I checked if the other person is _available_ to receive feedback?
- What do I want them to feel—supported, shamed, or changed?
- What _parts_ of me are driving the urge to “be honest” right now?
