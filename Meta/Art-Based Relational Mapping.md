# 🎨 Art-Based Relational Mapping

**Art-Based Relational Mapping** is a creative self-reflection tool that visually explores the **landscape of your relationships**—past or present—through imagery, metaphor, symbol, and spatial arrangement. This practice is often used to **surface emotional patterns, energetic dynamics, unmet needs, and systemic influences** that may be hard to articulate in linear or verbal formats.

> “Sometimes we need to _see_ a relationship to _feel_ it fully.”

## 🧠 Core Principles

| Principle                    | Description                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Relational Ecosystems**    | We exist in webs of connection—each thread holds emotion, history, and influence |
| **Non-Linear Expression**    | Symbols and images allow emotional truth to emerge without overthinking          |
| **Embodied Insight**         | Using hands, movement, and color taps into somatic knowing                       |
| **Meaning Through Metaphor** | Visual metaphors (storms, roots, bridges, walls) can reveal unconscious truths   |
| **Process Over Product**     | The goal is reflection and resonance—not artistic “skill”                        |

## 💬 Reflection Questions

- What surprised me in this map?
- Which parts felt tender, avoidant, or overemphasized?
- Where are the sources of nourishment or depletion?
- How do power, care, or safety show up in this system?
- What relationships are asking for repair, change, or letting go?

## 🧠 Integration Practices

- Journal alongside the image: give each symbol or placement a voice
- Use map as a check-in tool before hard conversations
- Revisit and re-map every few months as feelings shift
- Use with parts work: who in your system resonates with which map elements?
