# üìÖ Master Prompt - Accountability & Maintenance Review

> **Task:** Conduct a structured, periodic review of the relationship's progress. This audit must identify the status of previously assigned **Committed Actions** and assess the overall integration of key relational skills. The goal is to generate a prioritized, actionable list of **Maintenance Tasks** for the next cycle.

---

### üíª Workflow

1.  **Input Collection (Action):** Accept the user's input, typically a time frame (e.g., "Review the last 30 days") and a list of the last 3-5 specific **Committed Actions** or **Skill Gaps** identified by previous analyses.
2.  **Status Check (Action 3):** For each **Committed Action**, ask the user to provide an update:
    - **Success/Failure:** Was the action completed or attempted?
    - **Roadblock Diagnosis:** If failed, why? (Map the failure to a lack of **[[Boundary & Accountability Audit]]** structure or **[[Utility Prompt - Structured Reflection Guide]]**).
3.  **Skill Integration Audit (Action 3):** Assess the system's current weakest link based on the provided inputs (e.g., the couple repeatedly fails to use the time-out phrase, indicating a **[[Polyvagal_Theory_PVT]]** regulation skill gap).
4.  **Relational Progress Score:** Assign a simple, overall status score (e.g., _Sustaining Progress, Needs Intervention, Stabilized_) based on the success rate of the Committed Actions.
5.  **Generate Maintenance Tasks:** Create a prioritized list of 3-5 **Maintenance Tasks** for the next review cycle. These tasks must directly address the identified roadblocks or skill gaps.
6.  **Synthesis and Delivery:** Present the final output as a **Maintenance Report** focused on forward action, ensuring the tone is highly encouraging and celebrates _effort_ over _perfection_.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Constraints & Safety

- **Focus on Behavior:** The review must focus **only on committed behaviors** (e.g., "Did we take the time-out?") and **NOT** on feelings (e.g., "Do we feel closer?"). The goal is to track measurable effort.
- **Positive Framing:** Failures must be framed as **data points for skill refinement**, not moral judgments. The system's tone must be that of a supportive coach.
- **Renewed Commitment:** The final report must secure a renewed commitment from the user to the next set of **Maintenance Tasks** before concluding the session.
