# 🎯 Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)

**Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)** is a third-wave behavioral therapy that aims to increase **psychological flexibility**—the ability to be present with what is, and to take action in alignment with one's values. Rather than eliminating distress, ACT helps people **relate differently** to thoughts, emotions, and sensations.

---

## 🔑 Core Processes (Hexaflex Model)

ACT is built on six interrelated processes that support psychological flexibility:

1. **Cognitive Defusion**  
   Observing thoughts as mental events, not truths.  
   → “I’m having the thought that…”

2. **Acceptance**  
   Making space for unpleasant feelings without trying to change or avoid them.

3. **Present Moment Awareness**  
   Contacting the here-and-now with openness and curiosity.

4. **Self-as-Context**  
   Observing self beyond roles, stories, or content—“the you who notices.”

5. **Values Clarification**  
   Identifying what truly matters to you.

6. **Committed Action**  
   Taking steps guided by values, not by avoidance or impulse.

## 🧠 Nervous System Relevance

- ACT supports **window of tolerance** expansion by encouraging non-reactivity to distress.
- **Values-based action** helps counter fawn/freeze patterns by reinforcing agency.
- **Mindfulness and defusion** reduce sympathetic overactivation (fight/flight) in the face of anxiety-producing thoughts.

---

## 🧩 Applications in Relationships

- Reduces relational reactivity by promoting **emotional willingness** and **non-fusion**.
- Enhances **values-based boundaries**: “What matters to me here?”
- Strengthens **self-differentiation** without detachment.
- Promotes compassionate witnessing over control or avoidance in conflict.

---

## 🔄 Integration with Other Frameworks

- Complements **DBT**: Combines acceptance and change.
- Pairs with **IFS**: Helps defuse from parts and choose values-aligned action.
- Informs **Consent Culture**: Clarifies internal yes/no from values, not fear.

---

## 🛠 Prompts for Reflection

- What thoughts are showing up that I can observe rather than obey?
- What emotion needs space, not fixing?
- What value do I want to move toward—even with discomfort?
- What small action would honor that value today?
