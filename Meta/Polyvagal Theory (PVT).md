# ðŸŒ¿ Polyvagal Theory (PVT)

**Polyvagal Theory (PVT)**, developed by **Dr. Stephen Porges**, explains how our **nervous system responds to cues of safety, danger, or threat**â€”influencing our emotions, behaviors, and relationships. It reframes trauma and dysregulation not as pathology but as **adaptive survival responses**.

The theory maps three primary states driven by the **autonomic nervous system** via the **vagus nerve**: **ventral vagal**, **sympathetic**, and **dorsal vagal**. Each state affects connection, communication, and regulation.

## ðŸ§  Core States

| State                          | Description                                   | Signals & Behaviors                                           |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ventral Vagal (Safety)**     | Social engagement, presence, calm.            | Open body language, eye contact, voice modulation, curiosity. |
| **Sympathetic (Mobilization)** | Fight or flight response to perceived danger. | Fast speech, fidgeting, anger, anxiety, urgency, avoidance.   |
| **Dorsal Vagal (Shutdown)**    | Collapse or freeze in overwhelming threat.    | Numbness, fatigue, withdrawal, dissociation, silence.         |

## ðŸ”„ State Transitions & Blended States

- **Blended States**: We often move between or combine states (e.g., fawning = ventral + dorsal).
- **Neuroception**: Subconscious detection of safety/threat in people, tone, environment.
- **State Shifts**: Not a choiceâ€”nervous system leads before cognition.

## ðŸ›  Applications in Relational Work

- **Co-Regulation**: One personâ€™s nervous system can help regulate anotherâ€™s (tone, posture, presence).
- **Tracking Cues**: In conversations, note shifts in tone, posture, paceâ€”clues to state change.
- **Repair**: Ventral access is needed for true repair; rupture in sympathetic/dorsal needs containment first.
- **Containment**: Use grounding, rhythm, pacing, and space to help return to safety.

## ðŸ’¬ Reflection Prompts

- What does ventral vagal feel like in my body? What helps me access it?
- How do I behave in sympatheticâ€”fight or flight? What tends to trigger it?
- When do I go dorsalâ€”shut down, disconnect, disappear?
- What helps me co-regulate with othersâ€”and what throws me off?
