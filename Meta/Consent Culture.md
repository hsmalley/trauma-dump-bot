# ✅ Consent Culture

**Consent Culture** is a relational framework and community ethic that centers **agency, autonomy, and attunement**. It expands the concept of consent beyond legalistic or sexual contexts into an ongoing, embodied, and relational process. In Consent Culture, **"yes" is only meaningful if "no" is truly safe.**

---

## 🔑 Core Principles

- **Ongoing**: Consent is a continuous process, not a one-time event.
- **Enthusiastic & Freely Given**: Consent must be uncoerced and revocable at any time.
- **Informed & Contextual**: People must understand what they’re consenting to, including risks and expectations.
- **Mutual**: Consent is relational—it’s not just about getting a yes, but _being in attunement with others_.
- **Embodied**: Consent lives in the body, not just in language. Somatic cues and nervous system responses matter.

## 🧠 Nervous System & Trauma Lens

- **Fawn Responses** may look like consent but mask distress or fear of conflict.
- **Freeze States** can impair speech or the ability to withdraw consent.
- **Consent-Informed** approaches emphasize _slowness, check-ins, and regulated connection_.
- **Re-consenting**: Normalizes pausing, changing direction, or renegotiating agreements.

---

## 🛠 Consent Practices

- **Check-ins**: “How’s this for you?” “Want to pause?” “What would feel good?”
- **Traffic Light Model**: Green = Yes, Yellow = Maybe / Slow, Red = No.
- **Explicit Scripts**: “I’m a yes to **_, but a no to _**.”
- **Withdrawal Normalization**: “You can change your mind anytime.”
- **Layered Consent**: Distinguish between physical, emotional, energetic, and logistical layers.

## 🧩 Cultural and Systemic Influences

- Socialization (gender, race, ability, age) may shape how safe people feel saying “no.”
- Structural power (class, institutional roles, legal status) impacts consent dynamics.
- Consent culture work includes **repair**, **accountability**, and **community support**—not just individual boundaries.

---

## 🔄 Integration with Other Frameworks

- **Boundary Models**: Supports agency without reactivity.
- **Polyvagal Theory**: Brings awareness to embodied safety and social cues.
- **Empowerment Triangle**: Moves beyond victim/rescuer/persecutor scripts into mutual empowerment.
- **IFS**: Helps identify parts that override consent or struggle to advocate.

## 💬 Relational Reflection Prompts

- Where do I feel safest to say “no” or “I don’t know”?
- How do I signal or sense a “yes” in my body?
- When do I override myself to avoid tension?
- How do I practice consent in non-sexual contexts (time, energy, presence)?
