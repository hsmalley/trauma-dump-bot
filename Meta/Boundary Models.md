# 🛡️ Boundary Models

**Boundary Models** describe how individuals define, protect, and express their personal limits, needs, and responsibilities in relationships. Healthy boundaries are not rigid walls nor total openness—they're flexible, responsive, and grounded in self-awareness.

## 🔑 Types of Boundaries

1. **Physical** — Personal space, touch, body autonomy.
2. **Emotional** — Capacity to separate one’s feelings from others’; not absorbing or managing others’ emotional states.
3. **Mental** — Respect for different thoughts, beliefs, and opinions.
4. **Time & Energy** — Allocation of availability, focus, and capacity.
5. **Sexual** — Comfort with touch, pace, preferences, and consent.
6. **Material** — Ownership, giving, lending, and sharing of physical items.

## 🔄 Boundary Styles

| Style      | Description                          | Common Cues                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Rigid      | Overcontrolled, overly defended      | Shutdown, isolation, "I don’t need anyone"       |
| Porous     | Over-accommodating, lacks protection | Fawning, burnout, “I can’t say no”               |
| Collapsed  | Boundaries ignored or violated       | Freeze, dissociation, “I don’t know what I need” |
| Functional | Clear, flexible, responsive          | Assertive, curious, “This works for me”          |

## 🧠 Nervous System Integration

- **Polyvagal-informed boundaries** attend to cues of safety and danger.
- States like **fawn** may masquerade as consent; collapsed states may bypass self-protection.
- Functional boundaries are easier to uphold when in a regulated (ventral vagal) state.

---

## 🔧 Consent Culture Alignment

- Boundaries are _self-defined_ and _dynamic_, not enforced hierarchically.
- Respecting boundaries is not about compliance but mutual care and attunement.
- Boundary work includes recognizing and honoring **“No,” “Not yet,” “Only if,” “Only here,”** and **“Until…”**

## 🛠 Practices for Building Boundary Skills

- **Containment Mapping**: What’s mine to carry? What’s not?
- **Boundary Scripts**: "That doesn’t work for me," "I need to pause," "I can revisit this later."
- **Micro-check-ins**: “Am I choosing this from agency or fear?”
- **Values Alignment**: Healthy boundaries protect what you care about.

---

## 🧩 Reflection Prompts

- What does “too much” or “not enough” feel like in my body?
- Where do I override my own signals in the name of harmony?
- What’s the difference between comfort, safety, and compliance for me?
- Where am I learning to trust that I can say no and still be loved?

## 🔄 Integration with Other Frameworks

- **DBT**: Boundaries as skillful means in interpersonal effectiveness.
- **IFS**: Parts may hold different stances on boundary-setting (fawn vs protector).
- **Consent Culture**: Boundaries are honored without punishment or coercion.
- **Empowerment Triangle**: Boundaries shift us from victim/rescuer dynamics into co-agency.
