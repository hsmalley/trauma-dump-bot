# 🔁 Transactional Analysis (TA)

**Transactional Analysis (TA)** is a relational psychology framework developed by Eric Berne that analyzes interactions (“transactions”) based on **ego states**—patterns of thinking, feeling, and behavior that emerge in different relational roles.

It offers insight into **repeating dynamics, unconscious scripts, and emotional reactions**, and provides tools for increasing clarity, autonomy, and emotional responsibility in communication.

## 👤 Ego States: Parent, Adult, Child

TA describes three core ego states—not as age or pathology, but as learned relational modes:

### 1. **Parent**

- Behaviors, rules, and voices learned from caregivers or culture.
- Can be nurturing or critical.
- “You should…”, “That’s wrong…”

### 2. **Adult**

- Present-moment, logical, emotionally regulated self.
- Assesses reality, solves problems, sets boundaries.
- “What’s happening now?” “What are my choices?”

### 3. **Child**

- Emotional, spontaneous, reactive part shaped by early experience.
- Can be playful or wounded.
- “This isn’t fair!” “I want…”

> Ego states are not inherently good or bad—they all have healthy and distorted expressions.

## 🔄 Transaction Types

### 1. **Complementary**

- Responses align with the expected ego state.
  - Example: Adult ↔ Adult → “What time’s the meeting?” / “3pm.”

### 2. **Crossed**

- Mismatch in ego states leads to disconnection or conflict.
  - Example: Adult → Adult / Child → “Why are you always so controlling?!”

### 3. **Ulterior (Covert)**

- Surface message differs from hidden emotional message.
  - Often used in manipulation, flirtation, or passive-aggression.

## 🧠 Trauma & Parts Integration

- TA ego states map closely to **Internal Family Systems (IFS)**:
  - Child ↔ Exiles or wounded parts.
  - Parent ↔ Internalized managers or critics.
  - Adult ↔ Self energy or regulated parts.
- Helps name **inner dialogues** and interpersonal projections.

## 🛠 Relational Skills & Practice

- Increase awareness of your own ego state: “Am I responding from Adult, Parent, or Child?”
- Redirect to Adult-Adult communication: “Can we talk about this when we’re both more present?”
- Use meta-communication: “I noticed I’m reacting like a scared kid right now.”

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- Which ego state do I tend to operate from when stressed?
- Do I carry an internal critical Parent or neglected Child?
- How can I respond from Adult even when others aren't?
- What patterns did I inherit—and do they still serve me?
