# 🔄 Motivational Interviewing (MI)

**Motivational Interviewing (MI)** is a client-centered, directive method for enhancing **intrinsic motivation to change** by helping people explore and resolve ambivalence. Developed by **William R. Miller and Stephen Rollnick**, MI emphasizes **autonomy, collaboration, and evocation**, rather than confrontation or persuasion.

It’s widely used in therapy, coaching, health care, and relational repair contexts.

## 🔄 Process of MI (Four Phases)

1. **Engaging** – Build rapport and safety.
2. **Focusing** – Clarify target for change.
3. **Evoking** – Draw out reasons, values, hopes.
4. **Planning** – Support steps forward, if readiness is present.

## 🌱 Example Prompts

- “What would you like to be different?”
- “On a scale of 1–10, how important is this to you?”
- “What might be a small first step, if you decided to go forward?”
- “What are the upsides of how things are now? What are the downsides?”

- [[Internal Family Systems (IFS)]] — exploring parts involved (insecure, excited, voyeur, self-critical)
- [[Nonviolent Communication (NVC)]] — tools for emotional expression and repair
- [[Trauma-Informed Care]] — recognition of chronic misattunement and sensory trauma

## ⚠️ Things to Avoid

- Persuading, confronting, or “fixing”
- Arguing with sustain talk (evokes more resistance)
- Imposing your agenda before readiness is explored
