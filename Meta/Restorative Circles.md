# 🪶 Restorative Circles

**Restorative Circles** are a structured practice within **Restorative Justice (RJ)** that bring together people who have experienced conflict or harm—those affected, those responsible, and relevant community members—to **share impacts, build understanding, and co-create repair**.

Developed and practiced widely in schools, community groups, activist spaces, and some legal systems, these circles are guided by **shared values, equal voice, and deep listening**.

> “The circle holds us all in mutual dignity and accountability.”

| Type                      | Use                                                                   |

## ⚠️ Ethics & Risks

- Must attend to **power dynamics** (race, gender, role, trauma history)
- **Facilitation quality** is key—poor facilitation can retraumatize
- Not a replacement for survivor-led boundaries or professional care
- Requires **follow-up infrastructure** (support people, resources)

---

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- What needs to be heard that hasn’t yet been spoken?
- What would a meaningful repair look or feel like?
- What roles do we each play in healing this rupture?
- What does safety mean—for each person in the circle?
