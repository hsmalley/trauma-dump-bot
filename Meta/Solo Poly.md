# 🌱 Solo Polyamory

**Solo Polyamory (Solo Poly)** is a form of **ethical non-monogamy** where individuals choose to **prioritize autonomy, self-partnership, and non-hierarchical relational values**. Rather than seeking a “primary” partner, Solo Poly folks design relationships around **freedom, flexibility, and connection without control or co-dependence**.

Solo Poly isn’t “single” or commitment-averse—it’s a **relational orientation** that centers the self as an autonomous being, not a stepping stone to couplehood.

## 🧠 Core Values

### 1. **Autonomy**

- Life design is self-directed: no assumptions about nesting, merging finances, or romantic escalation.
- Relationships are **chosen, not prescribed**.

### 2. **Intentional Design**

- Each connection is unique—no “default” roles or obligations.
- Emphasis on _relational ethics_, not relational hierarchy.

### 3. **Self-Partnering**

- Prioritizing the relationship with self as foundational.
- Can include rituals, reflection, boundaries, and life planning with oneself in mind.

### 4. **Freedom + Care**

- Solo Poly is not avoidant—it’s a **loving ethic of independence + interconnection**.

## 🛠 Practices & Agreements

- Clarifying what _partnership_ means without shared domesticity or titles.
- Practicing _anchor relationships_ without hierarchy.
- Defining “commitment” on one’s own terms (e.g., time, depth, trust—not enmeshment).
- Building **solo support systems**: friends, co-regulators, and chosen family.

## ⚠️ Common Misconceptions

- **Myth: “Solo Poly = commitment-phobic”**  
  → Solo Poly often includes long-term, deeply intimate bonds—just not defined by cohabitation or hierarchy.

- **Myth: “Solo = single”**  
  → Many Solo Poly people are richly partnered—but hold their sovereignty as central.

- **Myth: “Solo = emotionally detached”**  
  → Solo Poly emphasizes _intentional, emotionally present connection_ without default scripts.

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- What does autonomy mean to me—and where does it meet intimacy?
- How do I define commitment outside of possession or prioritization?
- What parts of me want freedom? What parts want security—and how do I hold both?
- How can I support myself emotionally _as_ a partner?
