# 🩻 Complex PTSD (C-PTSD)

**Complex PTSD (C-PTSD)** is a trauma condition arising from **chronic, repeated, or relational trauma**, often during early development or in environments where escape or protection was not possible. Unlike single-incident PTSD, C-PTSD is marked by **shame, emotional dysregulation, fragmented identity, and relational distress**—not just flashbacks or fear-based triggers.

> “C-PTSD is the wound of being chronically unsafe in the presence of others—or in your own mind.”

## 🧠 Core Features (ICD-11 / trauma-informed models)

| Domain                      | Patterns                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Emotional Dysregulation** | Intense mood swings, shutdowns, rage, emotional numbness                    |
| **Negative Self-Concept**   | Chronic shame, guilt, worthlessness, inner critic parts                     |
| **Relational Struggles**    | Distrust, isolation, clinginess, protest behavior, fawning                  |
| **Somatic Symptoms**        | Fatigue, pain, dissociation, gastrointestinal issues                        |
| **Altered Consciousness**   | Dissociation, time loss, intrusive parts, freeze states                     |
| **Attachment Wounds**       | Disorganized or avoidant attachment, protest behaviors, fear of abandonment |

## 🔄 Survival Strategies (Parts-Based)

| Mode                | Description                                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Fawn**            | Appease to reduce threat or prevent abandonment |
| **Fight**           | Control, perfectionism, or explosive reactions  |
| **Flight**          | Hyperactivity, overworking, anxiety spirals     |
| **Freeze**          | Shutdown, passivity, dissociation               |
| **Submit/Collapse** | Resignation, identity diffusion, self-erasure   |

These modes are **adaptive responses**, not pathologies.

## 🌱 Healing Needs

- **Relational safety** — trustworthy, consistent, attuned connection
- **Containment capacity** — scaffolding for big emotions and flashbacks
- **Parts integration** — understanding the inner system of protectors and exiles
- **Somatic reconnection** — rebuilding relationship with body, movement, and sensation
- **Boundary repair** — reclaiming agency, pacing, and protective instincts

---

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- What parts of me are still living in survival mode?
- Where do I override my boundaries to stay connected?
- What sensations do I avoid—and what do they protect me from?
- What would safety _feel_ like, not just look like?

---

## 🛠 Supportive Practices

- **IFS or Parts Work** — Externalize inner critics, nurturers, exiles, and protectors
- **Polyvagal Practices** — Co-regulation, vagus nerve stimulation, and state awareness
- **Containment Exercises** — Journaling, sensory anchoring, visualized containers
- **Trauma-Informed Relational Scripts** — Boundaries, repair, rupture pacing
- **Window of Tolerance Tracking** — Visual or felt sense of overwhelm vs shutdown

---

## ⚠️ Relational Patterns

- May reenact trauma dynamics unconsciously (e.g., trauma bonding, caretaker roles)
- Hypervigilance can read neutrality as threat or disconnection as abandonment
- Deep craving for attunement often coexists with fear of being truly seen
- Repair attempts may trigger collapse or defense
