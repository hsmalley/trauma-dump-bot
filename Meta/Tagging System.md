# 🏷 Tagging System

This vault uses a **controlled set of tags** to maintain consistency.

---

## Core Tags

- `framework` → Theoretical models (e.g., [[Polyvagal_Theory]])
- `prompt` → Structured instructions for analysis
- `template` → Pre-built reusable structures
- `reference` → Reading lists, resources, example conversations
- `meta` → Guidelines, structure, system notes

---

## Additional Tags (Optional)

- `analysis` → Deep dives or worked examples
- `reflection` → Personal notes and journaling
- `example` → Example transcripts, case notes

---

## Usage Rules

- Apply **at least one core tag** to every note.
- Use **lowercase** for all tags.
- Avoid creating ad-hoc tags — extend only if needed.
