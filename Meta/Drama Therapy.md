# 🎭 Drama Therapy

**Drama Therapy** is an experiential healing modality that uses **theatrical tools—like roleplay, storytelling, improvisation, movement, and performance**—to explore identity, express emotion, resolve inner conflict, and process trauma.

Rooted in psychology, theatre, and ritual, it supports integration by making space for **multiple truths, hidden parts, and embodied experience**. Drama therapy is often used in individual, group, and community healing contexts.

> “Sometimes the safest way to tell the truth is through a mask.”

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept                   | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Role Theory**           | We contain many roles (e.g. Parent, Rebel, Caretaker, Exile) that shape how we behave and feel |
| **Embodied Expression**   | Movement, gesture, and voice help externalize and integrate inner experiences                  |
| **Projective Techniques** | Puppets, masks, stories, or symbols allow emotional distance and safety                        |
| **Enactment**             | Playing out scenes from past, present, or imagined futures helps rewire responses              |
| **Witnessing**            | Being seen in performance (even metaphorically) allows validation and integration              |

## ⚠️ Care and Containment

| Consideration                 | Why It Matters                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pacing**                    | Reenactments must be trauma-informed and titrated                             |
| **Consent**                   | Participation is always invitational, not forced                              |
| **Cultural Safety**           | Theatre may carry colonial or normative baggage—decolonized approaches matter |
| **Post-Enactment Processing** | Integration space is critical—what did the body learn or release?             |
