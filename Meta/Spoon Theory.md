# 🥄 Spoon Theory

**Spoon Theory** is a metaphor for **energy management**, originally created by Christine Miserandino to describe the limited daily capacity of people with **chronic illness**. In broader use, it has become a language of **access, pacing, and disability justice**—used by many neurodivergent, disabled, and trauma-impacted people to **name and protect their energy**.

> “I only have so many spoons today.” = I’m working with limited capacity and need to prioritize carefully.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Term                | Meaning                                                                          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Spoons**          | Units of energy or capacity; limited and variable day to day                     |
| **Spoonie**         | A person who uses Spoon Theory to describe their experience of energy limitation |
| **No-Spoon Zone**   | A state of complete depletion; physical, cognitive, or emotional collapse        |
| **Pre-Spoon Drain** | Anxiety, dread, or executive dysfunction that _precedes_ activity                |
| **Spoon Theft**     | When something (or someone) drains energy without consent or support             |

## 🧩 Practical Uses

- Describes **invisible disability** and supports **self-advocacy**
- Helps with **prioritizing**, **boundary-setting**, and **planning**
- Offers a **shared language** for support and capacity in relationships
- Encourages **non-moralizing** views of rest and energy management
- Used in **care teams**, **ND-friendly workspaces**, and **mutual aid**

---

## 🌱 Capacity-Based Practices

- **Spoon Mapping** — Track what costs and restores spoons across body, tasks, time
- **Traffic Light System** — Green = regulated, Yellow = caution, Red = depletion
- **Buffer Time & Spoon Banking** — Build in recovery time after high-cost activities
- **Spoon Forecasting** — Planning based on projected capacity, not rigid calendars
- **“I Can’t, But Here’s What I Can” Scripts** — Boundaried collaboration and delegation

---

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- What tasks drain my spoons most unexpectedly?
- What does a “full spoon” day feel like in my body?
- Where do I feel pressure to spend spoons to earn care or inclusion?
- What are my top 3 spoon-givers?

---

## ⚠️ Cautions

- **Not all spoons are equal** — Emotional, social, cognitive, and sensory costs differ
- **Spoon Language Isn’t Universal** — Always ask if others use or understand it
- **Spoon Bypassing** — Self-gaslighting or shame for needing more rest or support
- **Spoon Debt** — Repeated over-extension can lead to burnout or flare-ups

## 🔗 Related Frameworks

- [[Complex PTSD]] — freeze states, fawn, and depletion cycles
- [[Consent Culture]] — collaborative check-ins around needs, pacing, and support
- [[Containment Models]] — where emotional energy needs boundaries or holding
- [[Disability Justice]] — collective care, anti-ableism, and access politics
- [[Internal Family Systems (IFS)]] — exploring parts involved (insecure, excited, voyeur, self-critical)
- [[Neurodivergence]] — pacing for energy fluctuation and masking fatigue
