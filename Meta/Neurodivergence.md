# 🧬 Neurodivergence

**Neurodivergence** refers to brain-based differences in cognition, perception, attention, learning, and emotional processing that diverge from dominant social norms. Coined by **Kassiane Asasumasu** and popularized by **Nick Walker**, neurodivergence reframes conditions like **autism, ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, Tourette’s, OCD, PTSD**, and more as **natural variations**, not pathologies.

> “Neurodivergence isn’t a disorder—it’s a mismatch between nervous systems and environments designed for conformity.”

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept                           | Description                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Neurodiversity**                | The broad fact that all brains vary—like biodiversity in nature                               |
| **Neurodivergence**               | A brain that diverges significantly from dominant expectations                                |
| **Neurotypical**                  | A person whose neurological development aligns with mainstream norms                          |
| **Neurodivergent-Affirming Lens** | Centers adaptation, identity, access, and consent—not compliance or cure                      |
| **Masking**                       | Suppressing neurodivergent traits to avoid harm or fit in; often exhausting and unsustainable |

## 🛠 Framework Features

- **Systems Critique** – Challenges ableism, productivity mandates, and normalization pressures
- **Identity Liberation** – Supports naming, claiming, and exploring one’s neurotype
- **Contextual Fit** – Focuses on environments that support regulation, creativity, and access
- **Interdependent Care** – Moves beyond independence as the gold standard
- **Consent & Communication** – Emphasizes customized relational strategies and mutual understanding

---

## 🌈 Examples of Neurodivergence (non-exhaustive)

- Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
- Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
- Tourette Syndrome
- Sensory Processing Disorder
- Auditory Processing Disorder
- Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, Dyspraxia
- Complex PTSD, trauma-based adaptations
- Bipolar, OCD, Schizotypal traits (under inclusive neurodiversity models)

---

## 💬 Relational Implications

- May require **non-normative communication styles** (e.g., scripting, silence, directness)
- Can benefit from **structured flexibility**, customized support, and sensory consideration
- Risk of **conflict, rupture, or rejection** in systems demanding conformity or speed
- May struggle with **self-trust** due to constant correction or invalidation
- Relationships often deepen with **mutual translation and meta-awareness**

## 💡 Practices for Support

- **Neurodivergent Mapping** – Identify strengths, support needs, regulation tools
- **Capacity-Based Planning** – Energy forecasting over time-blocking
- **Mutual Aid Models** – Interdependence as resilience
- **De-Masking Spaces** – Environments where divergence is invited, not punished
- **Consent-Based Relationships** – Prioritizing pacing, clarity, and safety over assumption
