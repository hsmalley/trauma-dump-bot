# ♾️ AUDHD (Autism + ADHD)

**AUDHD** refers to people who are both **autistic** and have **ADHD**—an increasingly recognized neurotype intersection with its own **patterns, challenges, and strengths**. While autism and ADHD are often diagnosed and studied separately, many neurodivergent people experience them **concurrently**—and the overlap is more **common than rare**, especially among AFAB, queer, and BIPOC communities.

> “Too fast _and_ too slow. Too much _and_ not enough. Every moment is a paradox—and that’s okay.”

## 🧠 Key Traits of AUDHD (Interwoven Patterns)

| Domain                     | Expression                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Focus**                  | Hyperfocus and distractibility can occur in quick succession; interest-based attention with difficulty shifting |
| **Sensory Regulation**     | Intensified sensitivities, both seeking and avoiding input; regulation needs can rapidly change                 |
| **Social Dynamics**        | Desire for connection + struggle with scripts, rejection sensitivity, directness misunderstood                  |
| **Time & Task Management** | Paralysis, time blindness, executive dysfunction, burnout cycles                                                |
| **Emotional Landscape**    | Intense emotions, alexithymia, masking, sudden dysregulation, and passionate engagement                         |
| **Identity Navigation**    | Fluid or paradoxical sense of self, frequent masking, identity confusion or shifts under stress                 |

## 🧩 Unique Challenges

- **Masking on Two Fronts** — Social norms _and_ productivity standards often feel impossible to meet
- **Internal Conflicts** — ADHD may seek novelty while autism seeks stability; creates tension in decision-making
- **Burnout Vulnerability** — Increased risk due to sensory overload + executive dysfunction + emotional suppression
- **Misdiagnosis / Underdiagnosis** — Especially common in AFAB, trans, BIPOC individuals who mask or present atypically
- **Relational Strain** — Others may perceive inconsistency, avoidance, or over-intensity without understanding the root

## 🌟 Strengths (When Understood)

- Incredibly creative, intuitive, and detail-oriented
- Deep pattern recognition combined with nonlinear thinking
- Passionate, values-driven, and loyal
- Strong justice instincts and sensitivity to authenticity
- Insightful about systems, people, and ideas—often ahead of their time

---

## 🛠 Supportive Strategies

- **Capacity Mapping** – Tracking energy, spoons, sensory needs across the day or week
- **Dual-Nervous-System Tools** – Combining structure (for ADHD) with consent-based routine (for autism)
- **Gentle Transitions** – Layered cues, buffering time, permission to shift slowly or skip entirely
- **Relational Scripts** – For boundary-setting, check-ins, and repair after dysregulation
- **Creative Routines** – Rhythmic rituals rather than rigid schedules
- **Self-Compassion Practice** – Naming the “both/and” nature of AUDHD without moral judgment

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- Where do my needs seem to contradict—and how can I honor both?
- What does it feel like to show up in a relationship without masking?
- How do my systems (internal or external) support or suppress my rhythm?
- What does care look like when I’m regulated vs dysregulated?
