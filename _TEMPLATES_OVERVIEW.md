# üìù Templates Overview and Quick Start Guide

This file provides a quick reference for the essential **Templates** used in the vault.
These templates are the primary tools for collecting structured data and initiating
repair, ensuring every step of your relational work is organized and actionable.

## I. Data Collection & Self-Work Templates

These templates are designed to structure your raw experience before running a deep
analysis or engaging with your partner.

### 1. [[Conflict Data Logger]]

- **Purpose:** This is your primary **data collection form**. Use this template to log
  the _facts_ of a conflict immediately after it occurs. It forces you to document the
  timeline, specific triggers, and observable behaviors, making the data clean for the
  **Triage Engine** to analyze.
- **When to Use:** Immediately after a conflict ends, or when you notice a persistent,
  problematic pattern you want to analyze.

### 2. [[Reflection Template]]

- **Purpose:** This template guides you through a structured, post-conflict
  **self-assessment**. It helps you identify your internal states, the **Parts** that
  were active, and the gap between your actions and your values, facilitating personal
  learning.
- **When to Use:** After the conflict is over, you are emotionally regulated, and you
  are ready to process your own experience privately.

## II. Repair & Action Templates

These templates are designed to structure the output of the analysis and provide a safe
framework for conversation with your partner.

### 3. [[Conflict Repair Template]]

- **Purpose:** This template provides the **structure for a successful apology or repair
  conversation**. It moves beyond simply saying "I'm sorry" to outlining clear steps for
  responsibility, empathy, and a future **Committed Action**.
- **When to Use:** When you are regulated and ready to approach your partner to formally
  close a conflict or rupture, using a script generated by the **Synthesis Prompt**.

_Note: These templates, along with the
**[[Utility Prompt - New User Onboarding & Guided Tour]]**, are your recommended
starting points for using the vault._
