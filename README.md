## Why?

I made this for myself first and foremost. I needed a way to better understand the
people in my life. Once I did that, I realized _Hey! This might make a really cool tool
for so many different things!_

## How to use

It's really simple, generate the a json file, upload it to your preferred chat bot and
and run the prompt... okay maybe that's not so simple...

### How to start using NOW

- Download the Relational_Analysis_Vault.json file from this repo
- Grab the Prompt from System_Prompt_JSON.md (the System_Prompt_JSON_mini.md is also a
  very fast way of getting it loaded)
- Upload Relational_Analysis_Vault.json and paste in the prompt
- ðŸš€ Bob es tu tio | via con dios ðŸ«¡

## How it should be used

Okay, so this is kinda tricky

## TODO

Setup some kind of Obsidian friendly github pages And maybe more...
