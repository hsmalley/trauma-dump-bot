# Welcome to Trauma Dump Bot!

> ðŸš§ Warning

> I'm a dumb ass, so don't like depend on this for anything. It's really just for doing dumb stuff
> Seriously, I don't know anything! Like I have some good ideas once in a while
> Just be careful with this stuff okay? I got no idea what could happen ðŸ˜…

## Why?

I made this for myself first and foremost. I needed a way to better understand the people in my life. Once I did that, I realized _Hey! This might make a really cool tool for so many different things!_

## How to use

It's really simple, generate the a json file, upload it to your preferred chat bot and and run the prompt... okay maybe that's not so simple...

### How to start using NOW!

Use the chatgpt bot if you want you the quickest way.

However to use on your own chat bot:

- Download the [[vault.json]] file
- Grab the Prompt from Prompts/System/[[Run Prompt from JSON.json]]

## TODO

Setup some kind of Obsidian friendly github pages
And maybe more...
