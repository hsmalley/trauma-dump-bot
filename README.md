## Relational Analysis Vault

This vault contains:

- **Frameworks**: Core and additional psychological/communication frameworks.
- **Templates**: Tools for analysis, reflection, and mapping.
- **Prompts**: [[GPT Relational Analysis Prompt]](s)
- **References**: Space for external material.
- **Data**: Spaces for data that needs to be analysed

Use [[Index|Index.md]] as your navigation hub.

## Why?

I made this for myself first and foremost. I needed a way to better understand the people in my life. Once I did that, I realized _Hey! This might make a really cool tool for so many different things!_

## How to use

It's really simple, generate the a json file, upload it to your preferred chat bot and and run the prompt... okay maybe that's not so simple...

### How to start using NOW!

Use the chatgpt bot if you want you the quickest way. The next fastest way is to download the repo, upload the zip file to your LLM of choice, tell it to extract it and run the [[GPT Relational Analysis Prompt]]

## TODO

Build tooling to generate the json file, already kinda sorta done, it's in the Meta/Tool folder. It's _okay-ish_ but needs some love
Setup get hub actions
Setup some kind of Obsidian friendly github pages
And maybe more...
