# ðŸ—£ Example Analysis: Internal Family Systems (IFS)

## Transcript Excerpt

> A: 'You never support me when Iâ€™m stressed.' B: 'Thatâ€™s unfairâ€”I do a lot for you.' A:
> 'But when I cry, you disappear.' B: 'A part of me just freezes and wants to leave.' A:
> 'And a part of me feels abandoned all over again.'

## Observations

- Aâ€™s Exile (fear of abandonment) blends with Critic part.
- Bâ€™s Firefighter part avoids emotional overwhelm.
- Neither speaks from Self-energy; polarization dominates.

## Dynamics

- Protectors collide: Critic vs. Avoidant Firefighter.
- Underlying Exile pain unseen by both partners.

## Insights

- Invite parts language: 'A part of meâ€¦' instead of accusations.
- Pause for unblending and Self-access.
- Encourage Self-to-Self dialogue: curiosity, compassion.
