## Transcript Excerpt

> A: 'Why are you ignoring me?'
> B: 'I just canâ€™t deal with this right now.'
> A: 'So youâ€™re shutting me out again.'
> B: 'I feel trapped when you raise your voice.'
> A: 'I only raise my voice because I feel desperate.'

## Observations

- A escalates into sympathetic mobilization (fight energy).
- B shifts into dorsal vagal shutdown (avoidance).
- Cycle of pursue (A) vs withdraw (B).

## Dynamics

- Mismatched states lead to misattunement.
- Both partners interpret survival strategies as rejection.

## Insights

- Encourage explicit 'pause' agreements when dysregulated.
- B can signal presence nonverbally to reduce Aâ€™s panic.
- A can soften protest with needs language (NVC).
