## Observations

- Four Horsemen present: criticism â†” defensiveness.
- Bids for connection missed; maps of inner world thin.

## Dynamics

- Negative sentiment override; failed repairs.
- No rituals of connection in place.

## Insights

- Use softened startup and accept influence.
- Replace Horsemen with antidotes (e.g., build appreciation).
- Add daily 'stress-reducing conversation' ritual.
