# ðŸ—£ Example Analysis: Attachment Theory

## Transcript Excerpt

> A: 'You didnâ€™t text me back before bed.'
> B: 'I needed quiet after the meeting.'
> A: 'Silence makes me feel abandoned.'
> B: 'When I feel pressure, I shut down.'
> A: 'I just want to know youâ€™re there for me.'
> B: 'I want that tooâ€”I get scared Iâ€™ll say the wrong thing.'

## Observations

- A shows anxious hyperactivation (protest bids).
- B shows avoidant deactivation (withdrawal).
- Both signal attachment needs indirectly.

## Dynamics

- Pursueâ€“withdraw loop fueled by misinterpretation of bids.
- Lack of explicit reassurance routines.

## Insights

- Create a predictable 'goodnight check-in' ritual (A.R.E.).
- Coach A to express needs directly without accusation.
- Coach B to provide short, reliable responsiveness signals.
