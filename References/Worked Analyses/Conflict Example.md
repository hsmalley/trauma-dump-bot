# ðŸ—£ Example Analysis: Conflict Example

## Transcript Excerpt

> A: 'You never help around the house!'
> B: 'Why are you always nagging me?'

## Observations

- A in sympathetic mobilization (Polyvagal).
- B defensive, possible dorsal withdrawal.
- IFS: A's 'Critic' part, B's 'Defender'.
- Attachment: anxious protest vs. avoidant shutdown.

## Dynamics

- Drama Triangle roles: A=Persecutor, B=Victim.
- Boundary blurring around chores/roles.

## Insights

- Reframe A's protest as a bid for connection.
- Coach B to acknowledge need before problem-solving.
- Suggest NVC reframing: 'I feel overwhelmed... I need shared support.'
