# ðŸ—£ Example Analysis: Containment Models

## Transcript Excerpt

> A: 'We keep arguing past midnight.'
> B: 'Iâ€™m exhausted and say things I regret.'
> A: 'Letâ€™s try a 30-minute cap and a pause word.'
> B: 'And a recap at the end.'

## Observations

- Lack of structure leads to overflow and reactivity.
- Fatigue reduces regulation and empathy.

## Dynamics

- Unbounded conflict expands; no shared closure.
- Both want containment to stay within tolerance.

## Insights

- Timebox hard topics; use timers and recap notes.
- Define pause words and cooldown protocols.
- Schedule debrief and next steps.
