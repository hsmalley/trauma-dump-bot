# ðŸ—£ Example Analysis: Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)

## Transcript Excerpt

> A: 'You donâ€™t care when I cry.' B: 'I do careâ€”I just freeze.' A: 'It feels like Iâ€™m
> alone with my feelings.' B: 'Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll make it worse.' A: 'I need to feel you
> with me.' B: 'I want to be there; Iâ€™m scared and unsure how.'

## Observations

- Secondary emotions (criticism/defensiveness) mask primary emotions (fear, longing).
- Cycle: pursue (A) â†” withdraw (B).
- Attachment needs unmet: accessibility, responsiveness, engagement.

## Dynamics

- Negative cycle organizes behavior and blocks bonding events.
- Both partners misread intent due to the cycle.

## Insights

- Name the cycle as the problem ('us vs. the cycle').
- Structure an enactment: A risks vulnerability; B responds with presence.
- Reinforce A.R.E. moments to build secure bonding.
