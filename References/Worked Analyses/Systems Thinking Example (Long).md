# ðŸ—£ Example Analysis: Systems Thinking

## Transcript Excerpt

> A: 'Why do our fights always spiral?' B: 'Because you wonâ€™t drop things.' A: 'I push
> because you avoid.' B: 'I avoid because you push.' A: 'Weâ€™re stuck in a loop.' B: 'I
> donâ€™t know how to change it.'

## Observations

- Reinforcing feedback loop: pursue â†’ withdraw â†’ pursue (stronger) â†’ withdraw (deeper).
- Delay effects: post-conflict distance increases future sensitivity.

## Dynamics

- Attribution error: each blames the otherâ€™s personality, not the loop.
- No leverage points identified.

## Insights

- Insert a timed pause as a balancing loop (structured break).
- Add meta-communication checkpoints (What loop are we in?).
- Small experiments; measure system response rather than blame.
