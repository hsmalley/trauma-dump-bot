## Observations

- Judgments replace observations, triggering defensiveness.
- Feelings and needs not explicitly named.
- Requests absent or implied.

## Dynamics

- Criticism â†” defensiveness loop (Gottman Horsemen).
- Escalation due to unmet needs and lack of clarity.

## Insights

- Translate to OFNR: observation, feeling, need, request.
- Model: 'When the dishes pile up, I feel overwhelmed; I need support; would you wash them tonight?'
- Practice empathy before problem-solving.
