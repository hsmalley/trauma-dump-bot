## Transcript Excerpt

## Observations

- Mutuality reduced; authenticity suppressed to avoid conflict.
- Disconnections unaddressed; no explicit repair attempts.

## Dynamics

- Cycle of protective distance undermines growth-fostering connection.
- Both long for mutual empathy and authenticity.

## Insights

- Name the disconnection; schedule structured repair dialogues.
- Practice mutual empathy rounds (speak/listen/reflect).
- Re-anchor norms: authenticity with care.
