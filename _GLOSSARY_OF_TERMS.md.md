# ðŸ“š Glossary of Key Relational Terms

This glossary defines the technical terms, acronyms, and specialized concepts used across the vault's Frameworks and Analysis Prompts. Definitions are concise, relational, and non-judgmental. This file is intended for quick reference during analysis.

---

### A

- **ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy):** A behavioral framework focused on taking effective **Committed Action** guided by one's **Values** while accepting difficult thoughts and emotions.
- **Attachment Style:** A predictable, learned pattern for seeking or avoiding closeness with partners (e.g., Anxious, Avoidant, Secure), developed in early childhood to manage emotional safety.

### C

- **Committed Action:** A concrete, behavioral step taken repeatedly in alignment with one's core **Values** (ACT), often used as the final, measurable step in a repair or boundary setting.
- **Cognitive Fusion:** The state of being "stuck" to a thought (e.g., "I am a failure"), treating it as an absolute truth or fact rather than a passing mental event.
- **Contempt:** A relational poison (Gottman) involving disrespect, mockery, or treating the partner with disdain. It's often the strongest predictor of relationship failure.

### D

- **Decentering:** The mental process of stepping back and viewing one's thoughts and feelings as separate mental events, rather than the core self. A key skill for emotional regulation.
- **Dorsal Vagal:** The most primitive state of the **Polyvagal Theory** (PVT), characterized by shutdown, collapse, helplessness, and dissociation ("freeze").
- **Double Empathy Problem:** The finding that communication failures between neurotypical and neurodivergent people are mutual, stemming from a difference in social processing, not a deficit in one party.

### E

- **ENM (Ethical Non-Monogamy):** An umbrella term for relationships (like polyamory or open relationships) where all parties agree to have multiple romantic or sexual connections with full knowledge and **Consent**.
- **Exile:** A young, wounded, or traumatized **Part** of the self (IFS) that holds pain, shame, or fear and is hidden away by **Protectors** to maintain daily function.
- **Experiential Avoidance:** Any attempt to control, suppress, or avoid painful internal experiences (thoughts, feelings, sensations), often leading to withdrawal or defensive behaviors in relationship.

### I

- **IFS (Internal Family Systems):** A framework viewing the psyche as composed of different "Parts" (Protectors, Exiles, Managers) that interact like an internal family unit.

### M

- **Masking:** The conscious or subconscious suppression of one's natural neurodivergent traits to fit into a neurotypical social environment, leading to chronic exhaustion and processing delays.

### N

- **NVC (Nonviolent Communication):** A framework for communicating needs and feelings clearly by translating judgments into objective **Observations** and clear **Requests**.

### P

- **Part:** A sub-personality or aspect of the self (IFS) with its own feelings, beliefs, and goals (e.g., The Inner Critic, The People Pleaser).
- **Protector:** A **Part** (IFS) that works hard to prevent the **Exiles** from being hurt or triggered again. They can be Managers (proactive) or Firefighters (reactive).
- **PVT (Polyvagal Theory):** A neurobiological framework that describes how the nervous system regulates states of safety, danger, and life threat, linking them to specific behaviors (Ventral Vagal, Sympathetic, Dorsal Vagal).

### R

- **Re-enactment:** The unconscious tendency to recreate the dynamics, fears, or specific events of past trauma or family-of-origin patterns in current adult relationships.

### S

- **Self-Energy:** The core state of being (IFS) accessed when **Parts** are unblended. Characterized by the 8 C's: Compassion, Clarity, Curiosity, Connection, etc.
- **Sympathetic:** The nervous system state of activation, characterized by mobilization, anxiety, anger, and the urge to fight or flee (high arousal).

### V

- **Values:** Core directions in life that motivate behavior (e.g., Honesty, Connection, Growth). They are never achieved, but actions move one toward them (ACT).
  - **Ventral Vagal:** The highest-functioning state of the **PVT**, characterized by safety, calm, social engagement, and openness to intimacy and connection.
