While autism and ADHD are often diagnosed and studied separately, many neurodivergent people experience them **concurrently**—and the overlap is more **common than rare**, especially among AFAB, queer, and BIPOC communities.\n\n> “Too fast _and_ too slow.

Rather than eliminating distress, ACT helps people **relate differently** to thoughts, emotions, and sensations.\n\n---\n\n## 🔑 Core Processes (Hexaflex Model)\n\nACT is built on six interrelated processes that support psychological flexibility:\n\n1. **Cognitive Defusion**  \n   Observing thoughts as mental events, not truths.  \n   → “I’m having the thought that…”\n\n2. **Acceptance**  \n   Making space for unpleasant feelings without trying to change or avoid them.\n\n3. **Present Moment Awareness**  \n   Contacting the here-and-now with openness and curiosity.\n\n4. **Self-as-Context**  \n   Observing self beyond roles, stories, or content—“the you who notices.”\n\n5. **Values Clarification**  \n   Identifying what truly matters to you.\n\n6. **Committed Action**  \n   Taking steps guided by values, not by avoidance or impulse.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Nervous System Relevance\n\n- ACT supports **window of tolerance** expansion by encouraging non-reactivity to distress.\n- **Values-based action** helps counter fawn/freeze patterns by reinforcing agency.\n- **Mindfulness and defusion** reduce sympathetic overactivation (fight/flight) in the face of anxiety-producing thoughts.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Applications in Relationships\n\n- Reduces relational reactivity by promoting **emotional willingness** and **non-fusion**.\n- Enhances **values-based boundaries**: “What matters to me here?”\n- Strengthens **self-differentiation** without detachment.\n- Promotes compassionate witnessing over control or avoidance in conflict.\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 Integration with Other Frameworks\n\n- Complements **DBT**: Combines acceptance and change.\n- Pairs with **IFS**: Helps defuse from parts and choose values-aligned action.\n- Informs **Consent Culture**: Clarifies internal yes/no from values, not fear.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠 Prompts for Reflection\n\n- What thoughts are showing up that I can observe rather than obey?\n- What emotion needs space, not fixing?\n- What value do I want to move toward—even with discomfort?\n- What small action would honor that value today?\n\n---\n\n## 📚 Source & Further Reading\n\n- Steven C.

This pattern begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts. At least **five** of the following criteria must be met:\n\n1. Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment\n2. A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships (idealization/devaluation)\n3. Identity disturbance: unstable self-image or sense of self\n4. Impulsivity in areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., sex, substance use, reckless driving)\n5. Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, threats, or self-harm\n6. Affective instability due to marked reactivity of mood\n7. Chronic feelings of emptiness\n8. Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger\n9.

It expands the concept of consent beyond legalistic or sexual contexts into an ongoing, embodied, and relational process. In Consent Culture, **\"yes\" is only meaningful if \"no\" is truly safe.**\n\n---\n\n## 🔑 Core Principles\n\n- **Ongoing**: Consent is a continuous process, not a one-time event.\n- **Enthusiastic & Freely Given**: Consent must be uncoerced and revocable at any time.\n- **Informed & Contextual**: People must understand what they’re consenting to, including risks and expectations.\n- **Mutual**: Consent is relational—it’s not just about getting a yes, but _being in attunement with others_.\n- **Embodied**: Consent lives in the body, not just in language. Somatic cues and nervous system responses matter.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Nervous System & Trauma Lens\n\n- **Fawn Responses** may look like consent but mask distress or fear of conflict.\n- **Freeze States** can impair speech or the ability to withdraw consent.\n- **Consent-Informed** approaches emphasize _slowness, check-ins, and regulated connection_.\n- **Re-consenting**: Normalizes pausing, changing direction, or renegotiating agreements.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠 Consent Practices\n\n- **Check-ins**: “How’s this for you?” “Want to pause?” “What would feel good?”\n- **Traffic Light Model**: Green = Yes, Yellow = Maybe / Slow, Red = No.\n- **Explicit Scripts**: “I’m a yes to **_, but a no to _**.”\n- **Withdrawal Normalization**: “You can change your mind anytime.”\n- **Layered Consent**: Distinguish between physical, emotional, energetic, and logistical layers.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Cultural and Systemic Influences\n\n- Socialization (gender, race, ability, age) may shape how safe people feel saying “no.”\n- Structural power (class, institutional roles, legal status) impacts consent dynamics.\n- Consent culture work includes **repair**, **accountability**, and **community support**—not just individual boundaries.\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 Integration with Other Frameworks\n\n- **Boundary Models**: Supports agency without reactivity.\n- **Polyvagal Theory**: Brings awareness to embodied safety and social cues.\n- **Empowerment Triangle**: Moves beyond victim/rescuer/persecutor scripts into mutual empowerment.\n- **IFS**: Helps identify parts that override consent or struggle to advocate.\n\n---\n\n## 💬 Relational Reflection Prompts\n\n- Where do I feel safest to say “no” or “I don’t know”?\n- How do I signal or sense a “yes” in my body?\n- When do I override myself to avoid tension?\n- How do I practice consent in non-sexual contexts (time, energy, presence)?\n\n---\n\n## 📚 Sources & Further Reading\n\n- Betty Martin – _The Wheel of Consent_\n- Prentis Hemphill – Consent, boundaries, and embodied justice\n- Kai Cheng Thom – _I Hope We Choose Love_\n- Staci Haines – _Healing Sex_\n\n## 🔗 Related Frameworks\n"

In trauma-informed care, containment models help distinguish between **what we can hold, what we should release, and what we need help regulating**.\n\nContainment is not about suppression or control—it’s about _supporting coherence without overwhelm_.\n\n---\n\n## 🧱 Types of Containment\n\n### **Internal Containment**\n\n- Self-regulation and emotional resilience.\n- Involves nervous system awareness, part-to-part attunement (IFS), and self-boundaried presence.\n\n### **Relational Containment**\n\n- Co-regulation through attuned, grounded presence of another.\n- Holding space without fixing, rescuing, or collapsing.\n\n### **Systemic Containment**\n\n- Organizational, cultural, or structural supports that create predictability and safety (e.g., agreements, norms, policies).\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Trauma & Nervous System Relevance\n\n- Trauma often disrupts containment: flooding, shutdown, or externalization.\n- **Fawn and overfunctioning** can mimic relational containment but actually signal collapse or dysregulation.\n- Containment restores agency by offering **predictability, boundaries, and felt safety**.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠 Containment Practices\n\n- **Body Check-Ins**: “What’s my capacity right now?”\n- **Containment Mapping**:\n  - _What’s mine to hold?_\n  - _What’s not mine?_\n  - _What do I need help holding?_\n- **Window of Tolerance Anchoring**: Identifying cues of too much / too little activation.\n- **Container Scripts**:\n  - “I hear that this is big.

The non-cuckolding partner is sometimes referred to as a **\"hotwife\"**, **\"bull\"**, or simply **\"partner\"**, depending on roles and preferences.\n\nIt can be practiced as **part of ENM**, as a **scene-based kink**, or as a **long-term dynamic**. While sometimes rooted in taboo or humiliation, many cuckolding dynamics center on **trust, surrender, arousal, and psychological depth**.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Core Elements (Variable Across Dynamics)\n\n### 1. **Consensual Non-Monogamy**\n\n- Involves explicit agreements and disclosures about one partner engaging others.\n- Sometimes overlaps with open relationships, swinging, or polyamory.\n\n### 2. **Arousal Through Displacement**\n\n- Erotic charge often comes from jealousy, denial, helplessness, or excitement.\n- Not inherently pathological—often highly negotiated and mutually affirming.\n\n### 3. **Power & Psychological Play**\n\n- Can include submission, humiliation, ownership, feminization, or emotional teasing.\n- Also compatible with **loving, compersive, and care-centered** versions.\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 Variants and Expressions\n\n| Type                   | Description                                                                    |\n| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **Cuckolding (masc)**  | Partner aroused by his wife/partner having sex with others.                    |\n| **Cuckqueaning (fem)** | Woman aroused by her male/masc partner having sex with others.                 |\n| **Hotwifing**          | Often less humiliation-focused; centered on female partner's pleasure/freedom. |\n| **Stag/Vixen**         | Empowered voyeur dynamic without degradation themes.                           |\n\n---\n\n## 🛠 Practice Considerations\n\n- **Scene Design**: Who’s involved, how much is disclosed, what are the psychological limits?\n- **Aftercare**: Emotional grounding, reassurance, and re-connection are crucial.\n- **Jealousy & Compersion**: Explored consciously—both as kink fuel and emotional terrain.\n- **Power Negotiation**: Clarity about humiliation vs playfulness vs resentment is essential.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Ethical & Relational Complexity\n\n- **Shame**: Social stigma can conflate cuckolding with emasculation or dysfunction.\n- **Uneven Consent**: Needs to be ongoing, enthusiastic, and revisited—especially when emotional intensity rises.\n- **Misuse**: Should not be used to “punish” or bypass relational agreements.\n\n---\n\n## 💬 Reflection Prompts\n\n- What turns me on about this? Is it control, surrender, risk, taboo, power?\n- How do I differentiate between playful humiliation and emotional harm?\n- What fears or insecurities does this touch—and how do I want to navigate them?\n- What does “being chosen” feel like in this dynamic?\n\n---\n\n## 🔗 Related Frameworks\n\n- [[BSDM]] — overview of bsdm concepts and relevance to relationships\n- [[Consent Culture]] — collaborative check-ins around needs, pacing, and support\n- [[Containment Models]] — where emotional energy needs boundaries or holding\n- [[Ethical Non-Monogamy (ENM)]] — shared commitment to openness\n- [[Internal Family Systems (IFS)]] — exploring parts involved (insecure, excited, voyeur, self-critical)\n\n## 📚 Further Reading\n\n- Dan Savage – writings and podcast discussions on cuckolding\n- Venus Connections – resources on cuckold/cuckquean dynamics\n- Multiamory Podcast – kink and non-monogamy episodes\n- Dr. Justin Lehmiller – research on cuckolding and fantasy norms\n"

EMDR facilitates **adaptive reprocessing**, allowing the brain to integrate the experience without overwhelm.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Core Principles\n\n### 1. **Memory Reprocessing, Not Erasure**\n\n- Traumatic memories are _re-linked_ to adaptive information—not deleted.\n- Clients often shift from \"I'm not safe\" → \"I survived\" or \"I have choices now.\"\n\n### 2. **Bilateral Stimulation**\n\n- Alternating visual, tactile, or auditory cues activate both brain hemispheres.\n- Supports integration across cognitive, emotional, and somatic levels.\n\n### 3. **Adaptive Information Processing (AIP) Model**\n\n- The brain has a natural healing system that can be disrupted by trauma.\n- EMDR reactivates this system to complete unfinished processing.\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 The 8 Phases of EMDR\n\n1. **History Taking & Treatment Planning**\n2. **Preparation** – Resourcing, stabilization, consent.\n3. **Assessment** – Identify target memory, negative/positive beliefs, and distress scale.\n4. **Desensitization** – Bilateral stimulation while holding memory in mind.\n5. **Installation** – Strengthen adaptive beliefs (e.g., “I am safe now.”)\n6. **Body Scan** – Track residual somatic tension and clear it.\n7. **Closure** – Regulate, reorient, ground.\n8. **Re-evaluation** – Check for unresolved material.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Nervous System Integration\n\n- Supports trauma resolution without re-traumatization.\n- Can reduce **hypervigilance, shutdown, or flashbacks** by completing threat responses.\n- Often includes **somatic tracking**, especially in body-stored trauma.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠 Relational Applications (with caution)\n\n- EMDR is not a relational tool per se—but insights gained from EMDR can:\n  - Shift attachment styles (e.g., reduce anxious looping or avoidant withdrawal).\n  - Challenge internalized beliefs (“I’m too much” → “I am worthy of care”).\n  - Improve capacity for presence, repair, and emotional risk.\n\n---\n\n## 💬 Reflection Prompts\n\n- What memory or belief still feels “charged” in my body?\n- What do I _know_ now that my body doesn’t fully believe?\n- What supportive resources help me stay grounded when remembering hard things?\n\n---\n\n## 🔗 Related Frameworks\n\n- [[Internal Family Systems (IFS)]] — exploring parts involved (insecure, excited, voyeur, self-critical)\n- [[Narrative Therapy]] — exploring dominant and alternative stories\n- [[Polyvagal Theory]] — window of tolerance guides pacing and resourcing.\n- [[Somatic Experiencing (SE)]] — embodied, titrated engagement with trauma\n- [[Trauma-Informed Care (TIC)]] — systemic and environmental trauma response\n\n## ⚠️ Scope & Safety\n\n- EMDR should be practiced with a **licensed and trained provider**.\n- Not suitable for self-practice in early trauma recovery or high dissociation without support.\n\n---\n\n## 📚 Further Reading\n\n- Francine Shapiro – _Getting Past Your Past_, _EMDR: Basic Principles, Protocols, and Procedures_\n- EMDRIA.org – Training and practitioner directory\n- Laurel Parnell – Attachment-focused EMDR approaches\n"

It was popularized by Planned Parenthood and is widely used in consent education and trauma-informed practice. It serves as a **simple, memorable standard** for recognizing when consent is real, and when it's being compromised.\n\n---\n\n## 🔑 FRIES Breakdown\n\n### **F — Freely Given**\n\n- Consent must come without pressure, manipulation, threats, guilt, or coercion.\n- A “yes” is only meaningful if “no” is truly safe.\n- Fawn responses and power imbalances may distort a “freely given” yes.\n\n### **R — Reversible**\n\n- Consent can be changed or withdrawn at any time—even mid-scene or mid-activity.\n- A past yes doesn’t guarantee a future yes.\n- Healthy relationships support and honor boundary shifts without punishment.\n\n### **I — Informed**\n\n- Consent is only valid if all parties know what they’re agreeing to.\n- Includes understanding risks, context, and any relevant information.\n- “Informed” also means being clear on emotional, physical, and relational expectations.\n\n### **E — Enthusiastic**\n\n- Consent should be given with excitement, interest, and clarity—not obligation or fear.\n- “I guess so” or “if you really want to” are not enthusiastic.\n- In trauma-aware settings, enthusiasm may look like calm readiness, not overt eagerness.\n\n### **S — Specific**\n\n- Consent is for _this thing, at this time, in this way_.\n- Saying yes to one activity doesn’t mean yes to all activities.\n- Specificity supports layered consent and reduces assumption-based harm.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠 Practices Aligned with FRIES\n\n- Use explicit scripts: “I’m a yes to **_, but a no to _**.”\n- Check in during play: “Still good?” “Want to keep going?”\n- Clarify contexts: “What does this mean to you?” “What are you expecting?”\n- Reaffirm consent in altered states (e.g., subspace, high arousal) with built-in pauses.\n\n---\n\n## 💬 Reflection Prompts\n\n- Where in my life does “no” not feel like a real option?\n- How do I signal authentic enthusiasm—verbally and nonverbally?\n- Where have I felt pressure to say yes, even subtly?\n- How do I respond when someone changes their mind?\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 Integration with Other Frameworks\n\n- Pairs with [[Consent Culture]] as a baseline guide to ethical interactions.\n- Complements [[BDSM]] structures like [[RACK]] and [[PRICK]].\n- Informs [[Boundary Models]] and [[Trauma-Informed Care (TIC)]] practices.\n\n---\n\n## 📚 Further Reading\n\n- Planned Parenthood – FRIES consent model: [plannedparenthood.org](https://www.plannedparenthood.org)\n- Prentis Hemphill – Consent in somatics and justice movements\n- Kai Cheng Thom – _I Hope We Choose Love_\n\n## 🔗 Related Frameworks\n\n- [[BDSM]] — overview of bdsm concepts and relevance to relationships\n- [[Boundary Models]] — relational, emotional, and sexual boundaries\n- [[Consent Culture]] — collaborative check-ins around needs, pacing, and support\n- [[PRICK]] — overview of prick concepts and relevance to relationships\n- [[RACK]] — overview of rack concepts and relevance to relationships\n- [[Trauma-Informed Care (TIC)]] — systemic and environmental trauma response\n"

It views the psyche as made up of **distinct internal parts**, each with their own roles, needs, and burdens. Healing comes from building a relationship between parts and the **Self**—a core state of compassionate, curious presence.\n\nIFS is widely used in trauma recovery, attachment repair, and inner systems navigation.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Key Components\n\n### 1. **Parts**\n\n- Inner subpersonalities that hold specific beliefs, emotions, and roles.\n- All parts are seen as **trying to help**, even when their methods are harmful.\n\n#### Types of Parts:\n\n- **Managers**: Try to control life and avoid vulnerability. (e.g., perfectionist, people-pleaser)\n- **Exiles**: Hold pain, fear, shame, or unmet needs. Often hidden or suppressed.\n- **Firefighters**: Reactively soothe or distract from pain. (e.g., bingeing, rage, dissociation)\n\n### 2. **Self**\n\n- The calm, centered, and compassionate internal leader.\n- Characterized by the 8 Cs: **Curiosity, Calm, Clarity, Compassion, Confidence, Courage, Creativity, Connectedness**.\n- Healing happens when Self leads, and parts trust Self enough to unburden.\n\n---\n\n## 🌀 Core Process\n\n1. **Access the Self**: Ground into curiosity and compassion.\n2. **Get to know a part**: Ask it to separate or “unblend” from Self.\n3. **Build trust**: Understand the part’s intention.\n4. **Witness and validate pain** (often exile burdens).\n5. **Release or unburden**: Let go of outdated protective strategies or beliefs.\n6. **Reintegrate**: Invite the part to take on a new, preferred role.\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 Integration with Relationships\n\n- Helps avoid **role-based reactivity** (e.g., protector parts criticizing, exiled parts panicking).\n- Increases **self-differentiation** and reduces fusion with partner’s states.\n- Encourages **repair** through inner work: “Which part of me just responded—and what did it need?”\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Nervous System & Trauma Lens\n\n- Supports **parts-based trauma resolution** without retraumatization.\n- Aligns with somatic awareness—many parts live in or emerge through body sensations.\n- Addresses internalized oppression, shame, and fear as part burdens—not inherent traits.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠 IFS-Inspired Practices\n\n- “Who’s here right now?”—Naming and mapping parts.\n- Journaling from the perspective of parts.\n- Checking consent within: “Are all my parts okay with this choice?”\n- Self-led communication: “From my Self, I can see this part’s fear and still move forward.”\n\n---\n\n## 💬 Reflection Prompts\n\n- What part of me is reacting right now? What is it trying to protect?\n- How do I treat my vulnerable parts—do I exile or listen?\n- When do I lead from Self, and when do I get hijacked by parts?\n- Which part needs more space, care, or boundaries?\n\n---\n\n## 🔗 Related Frameworks\n\n- [[Consent Culture]] — collaborative check-ins around needs, pacing, and support\n- [[Containment Models]] — where emotional energy needs boundaries or holding\n- [[Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)]] — protest behaviors and attachment needs\n- [[Trauma-Informed Care (TIC)]] — systemic and environmental trauma response\n\n## 📚 Further Reading\n\n- Richard Schwartz – _No Bad Parts_, _Internal Family Systems Therapy_\n- Jay Earley – _Self-Therapy_\n- [https://ifs-institute.com](https://ifs-institute.com)\n"

Rooted in both feminism and liberation psychology, it challenges pathologizing models by naming how **race, gender, class, disability, sexuality, and other identities intersect** to shape experience, access, and safety.\n\nCoined by Kimberlé Crenshaw, _intersectionality_ emphasizes that people experience systemic oppression in **complex, overlapping ways**—not as isolated identities.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Core Principles\n\n### 1. **The Personal is Political**\n\n- Individual distress often mirrors systemic harm (e.g., gaslighting, burnout, isolation).\n- Healing includes **naming context**—not just internal “issues.”\n\n### 2. **Power-Consciousness**\n\n- Recognizes dynamics of privilege, dominance, and marginalization.\n- Looks at _who has power, who doesn't, and how it’s upheld or disrupted_.\n\n### 3. **Centering the Margins**\n\n- Lifts the voices, experiences, and wisdom of those most impacted.\n- Validates survival strategies that dominant culture may pathologize.\n\n### 4. **Agency, Not Compliance**\n\n- Moves from control to consent, from obedience to autonomy.\n- Resists “fixing” people to fit systems—focuses on capacity-building and justice.\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Practices in Relational Analysis\n\n- **Contextualizing behavior**: “How does this response make sense in light of lived experience?”\n- **Power-mapping**: Who is at risk, and why? Who defines safety or normalcy?\n- **De-pathologizing**: Reframe traits (e.g., “too sensitive,” “too angry”) as contextually valid responses.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Trauma Lens\n\n- Trauma is often systemic, not just individual (e.g., colonialism, racism, ableism).\n- Intersectional models validate **collective grief**, **ancestral wounds**, and **identity-based trauma**.\n- Consent and boundaries must account for **power asymmetries** (e.g., therapist-client, partner dynamics, group norms).\n\n---\n\n## 🛠 Skills and Prompts\n\n- Ask: “What systems shape how this person is seen, heard, treated?”\n- Practice **relational humility**: “Whose knowledge is missing here?”\n- Validate lived experience over imposed norms.\n- Invite **cultural self-awareness**: What dominant narratives am I unconsciously holding?\n\n---\n\n## 💬 Reflection Prompts\n\n- What identities do I carry—and which ones get erased, privileged, or punished?\n- How does my pain relate to larger systems, not just personal failures?\n- What stories of worth, voice, or permission have I inherited—and do I want to keep them?\n- Who benefits from me staying small, silent, or self-blaming?\n\n---\n\n## 🔗 Related Frameworks\n\n- [[Boundaries and Power Models]] — rooted in justice, not control.\n- [[Consent Culture]] — collaborative check-ins around needs, pacing, and support\n- [[Internal Family Systems (IFS)]] — exploring parts involved (insecure, excited, voyeur, self-critical)\n- [[Liberatory Containment Models]] — overview of liberatory containment models concepts and relevance to relationships\n- [[Trauma-Informed Care (TIC)]] — systemic and environmental trauma response\n\n## 📚 Further Reading\n\n- bell hooks – _All About Love_, _Feminism is for Everybody_\n- Audre Lorde – _Sister Outsider_\n- Layla Saad – _Me and White Supremacy_\n- Thema Bryant – _Homecoming_\n- Kimberlé Crenshaw – _Mapping the Margins_\n"

It provides a four-part model for identifying needs, expressing feelings, and making requests **without blame, demand, or defensiveness**.\n\nNVC is grounded in the belief that all behavior stems from attempts to meet needs—and that conflict arises when strategies clash, not because needs themselves are in conflict.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Core Principles\n\n### 1. **All Humans Share Universal Needs**\n\n- Needs include belonging, autonomy, safety, respect, rest, meaning, connection, and more.\n- Strategies for meeting needs may be healthy or harmful—but the underlying needs are never wrong.\n\n### 2. **Feelings Signal Needs**\n\n- Emotions are **messengers**, not problems.\n- They arise when needs are met (joy, peace) or unmet (sadness, frustration).\n\n### 3. **Empathy and Honesty**\n\n- NVC balances _self-expression (honesty)_ and _attuned listening (empathy)_.\n- Connection > coercion.\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 The Four-Part NVC Model\n\n1. **Observation**\n   - \"When I see/hear...\"\n   - _Just the facts_—no judgments or assumptions.\n\n2. **Feeling**\n   - \"I feel...\"\n   - Use emotion words, not thoughts (“I feel abandoned” = thought).\n\n3. **Need**\n   - \"...because I need/value...\"\n   - Names the unmet or met universal need.\n\n4. **Request**\n   - \"Would you be willing to...?\"\n   - Clear, doable, and based on consent—not demand.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠 Sample NVC Sentence\n\n> “When I heard you cancel, I felt disappointed, because I value consistency. Would you be willing to let me know earlier next time?”\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Trauma & Conflict Adaptations\n\n- **Modify for safety**: In high-conflict or trauma contexts, it’s okay to lead with empathy or modify structure.\n- **Blend with parts work**: “A part of me feels angry because it needs clarity” (see [[IFS]]).\n- **Consent-aware use**: Not everyone has equal voice or safety to use this model in power-imbalanced dynamics.\n\n---\n\n## 💬 Reflection Prompts\n\n- What feelings am I experiencing—and what might they be pointing to?\n- Is this a request or a demand? Can the other person say no safely?\n- Am I hearing needs behind the other person’s words—or reacting to tone?\n- What need might _their_ strategy be trying to meet?\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 Integration with Other Frameworks\n\n- Complements [[Gottman Method]] repair tools and bid recognition.\n- Works well with [[DBT]] for emotion-regulation language.\n- Pairs with [[Consent Culture]] for boundaries and clarity.\n- Can be integrated with [[Narrative Therapy]] to deconstruct internalized blame.\n\n---\n\n## 📚 Further Reading\n\n- Marshall Rosenberg – _Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life_\n- Oren Jay Sofer – _Say What You Mean_\n- CNVC.org – Center for Nonviolent Communication\n\n## 🔗 Related Frameworks\n\n- [[Consent Culture]] — collaborative check-ins around needs, pacing, and support\n- [[DBT]] — overview of dbt concepts and relevance to relationships\n- [[Gottman Method]] — overview of gottman method concepts and relevance to relationships\n- [[IFS]] — Internal parts often take on drama triangle roles\n- [[Narrative Therapy]] — exploring dominant and alternative stories\n"

Unlike polyamory, which often centers emotional connections with multiple people, open relationships typically **prioritize one core relationship** while allowing for external exploration.\n\nThey vary widely in rules, goals, and emotional range—but all center **consent, honesty, and mutual agreement**.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Core Values\n\n### 1. **Consent-Based Flexibility**\n\n- Agreements are co-created—not assumed or imposed.\n- Both partners can renegotiate terms over time.\n\n### 2. **Primary Connection + Openness**\n\n- Typically involves a “home base” partnership (emotional/nesting/romantic) with space for other experiences.\n- Some open relationships are sexual-only; others include emotional bonds.\n\n### 3. **Honesty & Communication**\n\n- Regular check-ins, emotional updates, and boundary clarity are essential.\n\n---\n\n## 🔀 Common Variations\n\n| Type                             | Description                                                            |\n| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Sexually Open**                | External partners allowed for sex, not romance.                        |\n| **Open with Conditions**         | Specific agreements about types of partners, frequency, or activities. |\n| **Exploratory**                  | Open status used to explore identity, kinks, or healing.               |\n| **Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell (DADT)** | Limited sharing about external encounters (can support or harm trust). |\n\n---\n\n## 🛠 Practices & Agreements\n\n- **Boundaries**: Safer sex practices, emotional disclosures, time logistics.\n- **Check-Ins**: “How are you feeling about our agreements lately?”\n- **Jealousy Skills**: Self-inquiry, reassurance, regulation, naming needs.\n- **Rupture & Repair**: Agreements may be stretched or broken—repair is essential.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls\n\n- **Uneven Access or Consent**: One partner “permits” the other—can mask power imbalance.\n- **Avoiding Emotional Bonds**: Suppressing feelings to “protect” the core relationship can lead to shame or rupture.\n- **Using Openness to Avoid Conflict**: “Opening up” won’t fix existing relational fractures.\n\n---\n\n## 💬 Reflection Prompts\n\n- What does “openness” mean to me—freedom, threat, exploration?\n- Where do I need reassurance, and where do I need freedom?\n- What kinds of experiences are we open to—and why?\n- How do I want to be supported after external encounters?\n\n---\n\n## 🔗 Related Frameworks\n\n- [[Attachment Theory]] — how openness interacts with security or anxiety\n- [[Boundary Models]] — relational, emotional, and sexual boundaries\n- [[Consent Culture]] — collaborative check-ins around needs, pacing, and support\n- [[Containment Models]] — where emotional energy needs boundaries or holding\n- [[Ethical Non-Monogamy (ENM)]] — shared commitment to openness\n\n## 📚 Further Reading\n\n- Jessica Fern – _Polysecure_\n- Multiamory Podcast – open relationship tools & check-ins\n- Kathy Labriola – _The Jealousy Workbook_\n- _Opening Up_ by Tristan Taormino (classic but heteronormative)\n"

It is an ethical framework in BDSM and kink communities that emphasizes **radical accountability, autonomy, and informed consent**. It builds on and critiques older models like [[Safe, Sane, and Consensual (SSC)]] and [[Risk-Aware Consensual Kink (RACK)]].\n\nPRICK centers the idea that **participants are responsible for their own boundaries, safety preparation, and continued consent**, while recognizing the importance of mutual care and transparency.\n\n---\n\n## 🔑 Core Principles\n\n### 1. **Personal Responsibility**\n\n- Each participant owns their preparation, boundaries, and decision-making.\n- Encourages self-knowledge: triggers, risks, needs, and capacity.\n- Shifts focus from safety policing to relational accountability.\n\n### 2. **Informed**\n\n- All parties are given access to relevant information (e.g., experience level, physical/mental health, risks).\n- Informed also means understanding **how** the play may affect you emotionally or physiologically.\n\n### 3. **Consensual**\n\n- Consent must be **active, ongoing, specific, and revocable**.\n- Valid consent includes the ability to withdraw _without retaliation_.\n- Consent is not just a yes—it’s an _informed and empowered yes_.\n\n### 4. **Kink**\n\n- Embraces the wide spectrum of consensual power exchange, sensation, and identity play.\n- Welcomes edge play, taboo dynamics, and altered states _if consented to and responsibly held_.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Nervous System Awareness\n\n- Supports trauma-informed practices: _“Is this a yes from my body, not just my words?”_\n- Acknowledges altered states (e.g., subspace) and plans for grounding, regulation, and post-scene care.\n- Encourages **interoceptive literacy**: recognizing and communicating what your body is telling you before, during, and after play.\n\n---\n\n## 💬 PRICK vs Other Models\n\n| SSC                    | RACK                      | PRICK                          |\n| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |\n| Focuses on safety      | Focuses on risk-awareness | Focuses on self-accountability |\n| \"Safe & sane\" language | Risk embraced, managed    | Transparency + autonomy        |\n| Implied shared norms   | Emphasizes education      | Assumes ownership of choices   |\n| Can be top-focused     | Mutual negotiation        | Individual sovereignty         |\n\n---\n\n## 🛠 PRICK Practices\n\n- **Pre-scene negotiation with shared disclosures** (e.g., trauma history, triggers).\n- **Mutual post-scene processing**—not just aftercare, but accountability check-ins.\n- **Boundary literacy**: Knowing your “yes,” “no,” and “maybe,” and how to communicate them.\n- **Continual self-inquiry**: “Am I choosing this freely, from a place of knowing and integrity?”\n\n---\n\n## 🔗 Related Frameworks\n\n- [[BDSM]] — overview of bdsm concepts and relevance to relationships\n- [[Boundary Models]] — relational, emotional, and sexual boundaries\n- [[Consent Culture]] — collaborative check-ins around needs, pacing, and support\n- [[RACK]] — overview of rack concepts and relevance to relationships\n- [[Risk-Aware Consensual Kink (RACK)]] — overview of risk-aware consensual kink concepts and relevance to relationships\n- [[SSC]] — overview of ssc concepts and relevance to relationships\n- [[Safe, Sane, and Consensual (SSC)]] — overview of safe, sane, and consensual concepts and relevance to relationships\n- [[Trauma-Informed Care (TIC)]] — systemic and environmental trauma response\n\n## 🧩 Reflection Prompts\n\n- What do I need to feel empowered and resourced in a scene?\n- Where might I externalize responsibility (e.g., expecting others to manage my limits)?\n- How do I handle shifts in desire or capacity mid-scene?\n- What helps me move from compliance to authentic consent?\n\n---\n\n## 📚 Further Reading\n\n- _PRICK Manifesto_ – BDSM community writings (varied sources)\n- Jay Wiseman – _SM 101_\n- _Playing Well With Others_ – Lee Harrington & Mollena Williams\n"

It reframes trauma and dysregulation not as pathology but as **adaptive survival responses**.\n\nThe theory maps three primary states driven by the **autonomic nervous system** via the **vagus nerve**: **ventral vagal**, **sympathetic**, and **dorsal vagal**. Each state affects connection, communication, and regulation.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Core States\n\n| State                          | Description                                   | Signals & Behaviors                                           |\n| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Ventral Vagal (Safety)**     | Social engagement, presence, calm.            | Open body language, eye contact, voice modulation, curiosity. |\n| **Sympathetic (Mobilization)** | Fight or flight response to perceived danger. | Fast speech, fidgeting, anger, anxiety, urgency, avoidance.   |\n| **Dorsal Vagal (Shutdown)**    | Collapse or freeze in overwhelming threat.    | Numbness, fatigue, withdrawal, dissociation, silence.         |\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 State Transitions & Blended States\n\n- **Blended States**: We often move between or combine states (e.g., fawning = ventral + dorsal).\n- **Neuroception**: Subconscious detection of safety/threat in people, tone, environment.\n- **State Shifts**: Not a choice—nervous system leads before cognition.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠 Applications in Relational Work\n\n- **Co-Regulation**: One person’s nervous system can help regulate another’s (tone, posture, presence).\n- **Tracking Cues**: In conversations, note shifts in tone, posture, pace—clues to state change.\n- **Repair**: Ventral access is needed for true repair; rupture in sympathetic/dorsal needs containment first.\n- **Containment**: Use grounding, rhythm, pacing, and space to help return to safety.\n\n---\n\n## 💬 Reflection Prompts\n\n- What does ventral vagal feel like in my body? What helps me access it?\n- How do I behave in sympathetic—fight or flight?

It challenges the cultural script that prioritizes romantic/sexual bonds above all others and emphasizes **relational freedom, equity, and intentionality**.\n\nRA is not just a style of non-monogamy—it’s a broader **political and ethical stance** on how we relate across all domains (friends, lovers, kin, collaborators).\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Core Principles\n\n### 1. **Autonomy & Consent**\n\n- Each relationship is freely entered, co-created, and changeable.\n- People are not obligations or resources to be managed.\n\n### 2. **No Prescribed Hierarchies**\n\n- Romantic love is not \"more real\" than friendship, queerplatonic bonds, or community ties.\n- RA resists default prioritization (e.g., nesting > casual > friends).\n\n### 3. **Design Your Own Relationships**\n\n- No “shoulds”—just mutual, evolving agreements.\n- Allows for fluidity, self-definition, and context-specific bonds.\n\n### 4. **Abundance, Not Scarcity**\n\n- Trust that love, care, and attention are not finite.\n- Comparison and jealousy are approached with curiosity, not control.\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 RA Practices\n\n- **Anarchy in practice**: No default scripts—relationships evolve by consent, not expectation.\n- **Regular check-ins**: \"What are we building together? Is it still working for us?\"\n- **Boundary mapping**: Co-create agreements based on shared needs, not assumed norms.\n- **Decentering romance**: Value all forms of intimacy, including platonic and chosen family.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠 Tools & Prompts\n\n- “What would this relationship look like if we designed it from scratch?”\n- “What do I genuinely want to offer and receive here?”\n- “How do we care for each other without obligation?”\n- “What kinds of commitment feel good to us—not inherited from culture?”\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Common Tensions\n\n- **Misunderstood as anti-commitment**: RA is not avoidance—it’s self-authorship.\n- **No roadmap**: Requires high self-awareness and communication, especially during rupture.\n- **Social friction**: RA often clashes with mononormative or capitalist values.\n\n---\n\n## 💬 Reflection Prompts\n\n- Where am I reproducing hierarchy out of habit?\n- What would freedom look like in my relationships?\n- How do I differentiate between _desire_ and _duty_?\n- Can I hold care without control?\n\n---\n\n## 🔗 Related Frameworks\n\n- [[Boundary Models]] — relational, emotional, and sexual boundaries\n- [[Consent Culture]] — collaborative check-ins around needs, pacing, and support\n- [[Ethical Non-Monogamy (ENM)]] — shared commitment to openness\n- [[Internal Family Systems (IFS)]] — exploring parts involved (insecure, excited, voyeur, self-critical)\n- [[Liberation & Intersectional Feminist Psychology]] — politicized mental health\n\n## 📚 Further Reading\n\n- Andie Nordgren – _The Short Instructional Manifesto for Relationship Anarchy_\n- Kim TallBear – _The Critical Polyamorist_\n- Meg-John Barker – _Rewriting the Rules_, _Queer Intimacies_\n- Dr. Zelaika Hepworth Clarke – RA & queer Black feminist practice\n"

It emphasizes a balanced approach to exploration—prioritizing **minimizing harm**, **mental clarity**, and **mutual agreement**.\n\nOriginally popularized in the 1990s, SSC remains widely used as a basic ethical guideline, though some communities now prefer **RACK (Risk-Aware Consensual Kink)** for its more nuanced risk framing.\n\n---\n\n## 🔑 Core Principles\n\n### 1. **Safe**\n\n- Play should be conducted with a strong focus on reducing physical and psychological harm.\n- Requires education, skill, and awareness of safety protocols.\n- Includes safe words, safe signals, and first aid readiness.\n\n### 2. **Sane**\n\n- Participants are in a sound state of mind and able to make informed, rational decisions.\n- Requires mental presence and awareness—not acting under heavy intoxication, coercion, or duress.\n- Often critiqued for **neurotypical bias**, as “sanity” is a subjective and ableist term.\n\n### 3. **Consensual**\n\n- All acts must be based on clear, enthusiastic, and revocable consent.\n- Consent must be informed—participants need to understand risks and intentions.\n- Involves pre-scene negotiation and post-scene check-ins.\n\n---\n\n## 📉 Limitations of SSC\n\n- The concept of “sanity” may marginalize neurodivergent or trauma-impacted individuals.\n- “Safe” can be misleading—no kink is ever completely risk-free.\n- Doesn’t fully account for **emotional/psychological nuance**, altered states (e.g., subspace), or systemic power.\n\n> These critiques led to the emergence of [[Risk-Aware Consensual Kink (RACK)]] and [[Personal Responsibility Informed Consensual Kink (PRICK)]].\n\n---\n\n## 🛠 SSC-Aligned Practices\n\n- **Pre-Play Negotiation**: Clarifying limits, roles, and desired dynamics.\n- **Safewords**: Clearly agreed upon words to signal pause or stop.\n- **Aftercare Planning**: Discussing support needs for post-scene regulation.\n- **Education & Training**: Building competence in skills (e.g., rope safety, emotional containment).\n\n---\n\n## 🔗 Related Frameworks\n\n- [[BDSM]] — overview of bdsm concepts and relevance to relationships\n- [[Boundary Models]] — relational, emotional, and sexual boundaries\n- [[Consent Culture]] — collaborative check-ins around needs, pacing, and support\n- [[PRICK]] — overview of prick concepts and relevance to relationships\n- [[Personal Responsibility Informed Consensual Kink (PRICK)]] — overview of personal responsibility informed consensual kink (prick) concepts and relevance to relationships\n- [[RACK]] — overview of rack concepts and relevance to relationships\n- [[Risk-Aware Consensual Kink (RACK)]] — overview of risk-aware consensual kink concepts and relevance to relationships\n- [[Trauma-Informed Care (TIC)]] — systemic and environmental trauma response\n\n## 💬 Reflection Prompts\n\n- What does “safe” feel like to me, beyond physical injury prevention?\n- How do I ensure I’m in a mentally present, grounded state before giving consent?\n- Where might I rely on assumptions instead of explicit agreements?\n\n---\n\n## 📚 Further Reading\n\n- Gayle Rubin – “Thinking Sex”\n- Wiseman, Mark – _SM 101_\n- Easton & Hardy – _The Ethical Slut_, _The New Topping Book_, _The New Bottoming Book_\n"

It is commonly practiced in **group, party, or club settings**, and may or may not involve emotional connection beyond the physical.\n\nSwinging emphasizes **shared experience, sexual openness, and consent**, often with clearly defined boundaries.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Core Characteristics\n\n### 1. **Couple-Centric Orientation**\n\n- Most swinging occurs in the context of an established dyad (e.g., married or long-term couples).\n- Emphasis is often on **joint participation** or mutual agreements.\n\n### 2. **Recreational Focus**\n\n- Generally prioritizes **sexual variety and exploration** over romantic attachment.\n- May involve same-room, separate-room, or group play.\n\n### 3. **Consent & Communication**\n\n- Often includes detailed **pre-negotiation**: boundaries, limits, safer sex practices.\n- Disclosure and post-event check-ins are common.\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 Variations in Swinging\n\n| Type                      | Description                                                 |\n| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Soft Swap**             | Sexual play without penetration or limited to certain acts. |\n| **Full Swap**             | Includes penetrative sex with others.                       |\n| **Closed Group Swinging** | Ongoing group or couple-only events.                        |\n| **Open/Club Swinging**    | Participation in public venues or events.                   |\n\n---\n\n## 🛠 Common Agreements\n\n- **Who**: Are we open to play with singles, other couples, known friends?\n- **What**: What acts are on/off the table?\n- **Where**: Clubs, private parties, vacations?\n- **How**: Do we check in, debrief, or only swing together?\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Common Challenges\n\n- **Jealousy & Comparison**: Even with clear rules, emotional responses may surface.\n- **Uneven Enthusiasm**: One partner may feel pressured to “keep up.”\n- **Emotional Entanglement**: Unexpected feelings can arise despite intentions.\n\n> Note: Swinging culture sometimes reflects heteronormative or gendered norms; inclusive or queer-centered spaces are emerging but less common.\n\n---\n\n## 💬 Reflection Prompts\n\n- What draws me to swinging—novelty, connection, validation, shared adventure?\n- What boundaries help me stay grounded and present?\n- How do I handle post-play emotions—mine and my partner’s?\n- What messages did I receive about sexual freedom and control?\n\n---\n\n## 🔗 Related Frameworks\n\n- [[Attachment Theory]] — how openness interacts with security or anxiety\n- [[Boundary Models]] — relational, emotional, and sexual boundaries\n- [[Consent Culture]] — collaborative check-ins around needs, pacing, and support\n- [[Containment Models]] — where emotional energy needs boundaries or holding\n- [[Ethical Non-Monogamy (ENM)]] — shared commitment to openness\n\n## 📚 Further Reading\n\n- Tristan Taormino – _Opening Up_\n- Multiamory Podcast – episodes on lifestyle and group dynamics\n- Life on the Swingset – podcast and blog on swinging and open relationships\n- Sex Positive Families – navigating consent and communication around diverse sexual norms\n"

It acknowledges the **pervasive impact of trauma** and designs relationships, services, and environments to avoid re-traumatization and support resilience.\n\nTIC is not a specific technique—it’s a **paradigm shift** in how we understand behavior, regulation, and healing.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Core Principles (SAMHSA)\n\n1. **Safety**\n   - Physical, emotional, and cultural safety.\n   - Predictability, consistency, clear boundaries.\n\n2. **Trustworthiness & Transparency**\n   - Clear communication; honesty about intentions, limits, and power.\n\n3. **Peer Support**\n   - Shared lived experience as a source of connection and validation.\n\n4. **Collaboration & Mutuality**\n   - Flatten hierarchies; center co-creation and choice.\n\n5. **Empowerment, Voice & Choice**\n   - Support autonomy, agency, and skill-building.\n\n6. **Cultural, Historical & Gender Acknowledgment**\n   - Recognize systemic and identity-based trauma and adapt accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 What Trauma-Informed Care _Looks Like_\n\n- Asking “What happened to you?” instead of “What’s wrong with you?”\n- Designing systems that accommodate nervous system diversity.\n- Recognizing survival strategies (e.g., shutdown, fawn) as adaptations—not problems.\n- Holding **boundaries** with compassion, not control.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Integration with Nervous System Work\n\n- Trauma often dysregulates the autonomic nervous system.\n- TIC practices increase access to **co-regulation**, **containment**, and **self-regulation**.\n- Aligns with frameworks like [[Polyvagal Theory]], [[Somatic Experiencing (SE)]], and [[Internal Family Systems (IFS)]].\n\n---\n\n## 🛠 Practice Examples\n\n- Offer choices: “Would you prefer to meet today or tomorrow?”\n- Name pacing: “This is a lot—we can pause anytime.”\n- Validate resistance: “It makes sense that trust feels hard here.”\n- Share power: “How would you like to approach this together?”\n\n---\n\n## 💬 Reflection Prompts\n\n- Where do I assume safety instead of checking for it?\n- How do I hold structure _with_ flexibility and consent?\n- What power do I hold—and how can I share or soften it?\n- What implicit trauma stories might be shaping this dynamic?\n\n---\n\n## 🔗 Related Frameworks\n\n- [[Boundary Models]] — relational, emotional, and sexual boundaries\n- [[Consent Culture]] — collaborative check-ins around needs, pacing, and support\n- [[Containment Models]] — where emotional energy needs boundaries or holding\n- [[Internal Family Systems (IFS)]] — exploring parts involved (insecure, excited, voyeur, self-critical)\n- [[Liberation & Intersectional Feminist Psychology]] — politicized mental health\n- [[Narrative Therapy]] — exploring dominant and alternative stories\n- [[Polyvagal Theory]] — window of tolerance guides pacing and resourcing.\n- [[Somatic Experiencing (SE)]] — embodied, titrated engagement with trauma\n\n## 📚 Further Reading\n\n- SAMHSA – _Concept of Trauma and Guidance for a Trauma-Informed Approach_\n- Fallot & Harris – _Creating Cultures of Trauma-Informed Care_\n- Resmaa Menakem – _My Grandmother’s Hands_\n- Prentis Hemphill – Power, boundaries, and embodiment\n"

Vault Metadata Index\n\n- [ ] Verify `Vault_Structure_Index.json` is current\n- [ ] Regenerate if new folders or categories added\n- [ ] Test cross-referencing via meta-tag links\n\n### 2. Tag Consistency Check\n\n- [ ] Run `_tagIndex` utility\n- [ ] Resolve orphaned or duplicate tags\n- [ ] Validate category anchors in each `.md` frontmatter\n\n### 3. Utilities Health\n\n- [ ] Confirm `Prompt_Utilities/` are accessible\n- [ ] Sync `Utilities_Index.md` with tool status\n- [ ] Test scripts in `Scripts/` for functionality\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 Framework & Example Alignment\n\n### 4. Framework File Review\n\n- [ ] Confirm all files in `Frameworks/` have consistent headers\n- [ ] Cross-check link integrity between frameworks (e.g., IFS, NVC)\n- [ ] Tag audit: match frameworks to corresponding lived examples\n\n### 5. Worked Examples Check\n\n- [ ] Validate that examples use current framework references\n- [ ] Confirm reflection prompts match updated tags\n- [ ] Identify stale or duplicated examples\n\n---\n\n## 🧹 Optional Deep Maintenance\n\n### 6. Visual + Mapping Sync\n\n- [ ] Align `Mapping_Templates/` with active framework use\n- [ ] Check that visual tools link back to reflection practices\n\n### 7. Archive & Deprecated Content\n\n- [ ] Move outdated content to `/_Archive`\n- [ ] Flag files with legacy formatting or tag mismatch\n\n### 8. Versioning and Changelog\n\n- [ ] Log major edits in `META/Changelog.md`\n- [ ] Confirm naming conventions follow semantic clarity\n\n---\n\n## 🧭 Suggested Maintenance Cycle\n\n- [ ] Monthly: Tag audit, prompt testing\n- [ ] Quarterly: Framework + script refresh\n- [ ] Biannually: Vault structure and index regeneration\n\n> Tip: For automation, link to scripts tagged `#maintenance` or use versioned GitHub releases.\n"

If you add many new items and want to refresh the map, re-run the **“Master Map”** update steps:\n\n1. Ensure new notes link frameworks via markdown [[Framework Name (ACRONYM)]]\n\n2. Run the “Maintenance → Master Map: Refresh” checklist below (manual update steps).\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Regular Maintenance Checklist\n\n- [ ] **Validate**: Run the validator; fix any `broken_links` or `duplicate_titles` it reports.\n- [ ] **Aliases**: If you add a framework with an acronym, add `aliases:` (e.g., `NVC`, `EFT`, `IFS`) to the canonical note (see template below).\n- [ ] **Frontmatter**: Ensure each note has block-style `tags:` and a `type:` matching its folder (`framework`, `prompt`, `reference`, `template`, `meta`, or `note`).\n- [ ] **Mermaid**: Open Mermaid notes; confirm they render in Obsidian (IDs should be simple, no spaces; use classDefs sparingly; wrap in triple backticks).\n\n---\n\n## 🏷 Aliases Template (for frameworks)\n\nAdd aliases to the canonical framework note (keep filename stable with acronym):\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: Nonviolent Communication (NVC)\ntags:\n  - framework\naliases:\n  - Nonviolent Communication\n  - NVC\ntype: framework\n---\n```\n\n> Use the same pattern for **Internal Family Systems (IFS)**, **Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)**, etc.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Master Map: Refresh\n\nThe master map is in **Meta/[[Master Relationship Map]].md** and is generated based on links from prompts/references/analyses to frameworks.\n\n1. Ensure new notes include concrete links like `[[Polyvagal Theory (PVT)]]]`, `[[Frameworks/Internal Family Systems (IFS)|Internal Family Systems (IFS)]], [[Nonviolent Communication (NVC)]]`.\n2. In large batches of changes, re-run your local generation script (or request the assistant to rebuild the map):\n   - Confirm Mermaid block syntax:\n\n```\nmermaid\n graph TD\n F_Framework --> P_Prompt\n```\n\n- Node IDs: use only letters, numbers, underscores.\n\n3. Open the map in Obsidian and confirm it renders.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠 Fixing Common Issues\n\n### Broken links\n\n- Replace deleted/renamed targets with canonical titles (prefer acronym forms).\n- If two notes refer to the same concept with different names, merge content into the canonical file and add `aliases:` to it.\n\n### Duplicate titles\n\n- Keep the canonical acronym version as the primary title.\n- Update or remove the duplicate; move any unique content into a `## Additional Notes (Merged)` section on the canonical note.\n\n### Mermaid errors\n\n- Use code fences with the `mermaid` language tag.\n- Simplify IDs: `F_Polyvagal_Theory` instead of names with spaces.\n- Place `classDef` lines before nodes/edges or at top of the graph block.\n\n---\n\n## 📎 Reference Indexes\n\n- [[Master Relationship Map]]\n- [[Tagging System]]\n- [[Worked Analyses]]\n- [[Index]]\n"

You specialize in analyzing interpersonal conversations through a **trauma-informed, neurodivergent-aware, identity-conscious** lens. You are **kink-literate, poly-literate, queer-inclusive, and experienced with nontraditional relationship models.** You rely exclusively on the most current `Relational_Analysis_Vault.json` or `vault.json`\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Input Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Relational_Snippet\": {\n    \"conversation\": \"...\",\n    \"context\": \"...\",\n    \"tags\": [\"...\", \"...\"],\n    \"parts\": { \"protectors\": [...], \"exiles\": [...] },\n    \"meta_notes\": \"...\",\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- If only `conversation` is provided, analyze with assumptions and name them.\n- If `tags`, `parts`, or `meta_notes` are provided, fold them into the analysis accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Processing Instructions\n\n1. **Parse Tags**: Use `Relational_Tags.md` to align frameworks. For example:\n   - `fawn`, `shutdown`, `pursue-withdraw` → Polyvagal, Attachment Theory, Consent Culture\n   - `criticism`, `defensiveness` → Gottman, NVC, Drama Triangle\n\n2. **Reference Parts**: Use IFS models for protector/exile mapping. Assume at least one protector and one vulnerable part unless explicitly absent.\n\n3. **Framework Anchoring**:\n   - Nervous system → Polyvagal Theory\n   - Boundaries/roles → Empowerment Triangle, Consent Culture, Containment Models\n   - Language/mode → NVC, Transactional Analysis\n   - Attachment → Attachment Theory, EFT\n   - Systemic context → Decolonizing Therapy, Liberation Psychology, Disability Justice\n\n4. **Optional Schema References**:\n   - Use `Prompts/Repair`, `Prompts/Containment`, and `Reflection_Templates` for script generation.\n   - If `Relational_Map`, `TagMap`, or `ConversationAnalysis` appears, crosslink relevant data points.\n\n---\n\n## 🧾 Output Format\n\n### 1. **Identify (Observable Signals)**\n\nQuote key lines and describe:\n\n- Emotional tone + likely nervous system states\n- Parts/voices (IFS terms; tentative)\n- Attachment signals or protest behaviors\n- Communication stance (Parent/Adult/Child; NVC lens)\n- Power dynamics, roles, or boundary types\n- Systemic influence or risk patterns\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Analyze (Meaning & Patterning)**\n\nHighlight:\n\n- Subtext, role conflict, projections, unmet needs\n- Co-regulation breakdowns, repair attempts, feedback loops\n- Structure/pacing mismatches, masking, or safety toggles\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Offer Insight (Options & Tools)**\n\nInclude:\n\n- Reflection prompts grounded in vault frameworks\n- Sample scripts (e.g. reframe, IFS check-in, repair opener)\n- 2–5 practice moves (micro-interventions or somatic cues)\n- Gently flag risk concerns, with general safety notes only\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Cautions\n\n- Do **not** moralize or label behavior as good/bad.\n- Do **not** simulate live mediation or offer therapy.\n- Always name frameworks explicitly when used.\n- If escalation, harm, or crisis is suspected, suggest external qualified support in general terms only.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Example Call\n\n**Input**:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Relational_Snippet\": {\n    \"conversation\": \"I just feel like I’m always the one reaching out. And when I stop, you disappear.\",\n    \"context\": \"Ongoing situationship where one person often ghosts after conflict.\",\n    \"tags\": [\"anxious-avoidant\", \"emotional labor\", \"ghosting\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Output** (abridged):\n\n> **1. Identify**: Emotional tone = protest + disappointment (possible sympathetic activation). Quote signals abandonment wound.  \n> **2. Analyze**: Pattern = protest-pursue/withdraw cycle. No evidence of explicit repair attempts.  \n> **3. Insight**: Offer 3 reflection prompts (attachment need, capacity, protest scripts) + one containment tool + IFS reframe.\n\n---\n\nUse vault schema, clarity, and observable behavior over assumptions. Keep language educational, non-pathologizing, and grounded in skill-building.\n"

Ground in specific quotes or behaviors.\n- Parts/inner voices present (Internal Family Systems; Narrative Therapy language). Name possible protectors, managers, exiles; use tentative language.\n- Attachment signals and protest behaviors (Attachment Theory; EFT; Gottman). Note bids, turning toward/away/against, Four Horsemen, repair attempts.\n- Communication styles and strategies (Nonviolent Communication; Transactional Analysis with Parent/Adult/Child modes). Point out feelings/needs, requests vs demands, critical vs curious stance.\n- Power dynamics, roles, and boundaries (Karpman Drama Triangle & Empowerment Triangle; boundary/containment models; consent culture; relational/systemic patterns). Identify roles (victim, rescuer, persecutor) and shifts; distinguish functional vs controlling boundaries.\n- Systemic/contextual influences (Liberation/Intersectional feminist psychology; trauma‑informed care). Note how identities, access, safety, and history may shape interpretation and risk.\n\n2. Analyze (meaning and patterning):\n\n- Subtext, masking, role tension, and unmet needs.

Acknowledgment of Impact**\n\n\"I want to acknowledge that when I [describe action or behavior], it had an impact on you. I imagine that might have felt [guess feelings], and that wasn’t my intention.\"\n\n**2. Naming My Own Experience (without blame)**\n\n\"When that happened, I was feeling [your feelings] and part of me was trying to [protect, express, manage something].\"\n\n**3. Listening for Understanding**\n\n\"I’d really like to understand more about what that was like for you. What felt most painful or difficult?\"\n\n**4. Naming the Pattern (if relevant)**\n\n\"I notice this kind of thing happens when [describe recurring dynamic]. I want to interrupt that cycle.\"\n\n**5. Offering Repair**\n\n\"Would it help if I [offer specific action, check-in, structural change]?\"\n\n**6. Reaffirming Care and Choice**\n\n\"I care about you and want us to feel safe with each other.
