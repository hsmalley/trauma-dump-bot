# üè† Vault Overview: Your Relational Analysis Dashboard

Welcome to the Relational Analysis System. This vault's purpose is to take complex,
painful relational data and convert it into **clear, actionable, trauma-informed steps**
for repair and growth.

This dashboard provides your map to the entire system.

## I. Core Philosophy

The entire vault operates under these three **[[_CORE_PRINCIPLES_AND_GOVERNANCE]]**:

1.  **Trauma-Informed:** Reactions are survival responses, not moral failures.
2.  **Systemic:** Problems reside in the **cycle**, not in an individual.
3.  **Action-Oriented:** The goal is always a measurable **Committed Action**, not just
    intellectual understanding.

## II. The Core Workflow (The 4-Step Loop)

Follow this four-step loop to turn a crisis into a learning opportunity:

1.  **Collect Data:** Use the structured input forms from the
    **[[_TEMPLATES_OVERVIEW]]** to capture the facts of the conflict while regulated.
2.  **Triage & Analyze:** The system (via the **[[02_MASTER_EXECUTION_Triage_Engine]]**)
    selects the precise diagnostic tool from the **[[_PROMPTS_OVERVIEW]]**.
3.  **Synthesize & Script:** The analysis is immediately passed through the **Safe
    Feedback Synthesis Utility** to generate a non-blaming, actionable script.
4.  **Repair & Commit:** Use the script and the **[[Conflict Repair Template]]** to
    engage your partner or commit to new individual action.
