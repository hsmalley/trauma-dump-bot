# 📝 Conflict Data Logger

> **Purpose:** Use this logger immediately following a relational rupture or conflict to
> capture objective data. This structured approach helps move you from emotional chaos
> to clear, analyzable facts, ensuring the Triage Engine receives clean input.

## 1. Context and Basic Facts

| Field                              | Input                                                                                       |
| :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Date & Time of Incident**        | [Date and Time]                                                                             |
| **Duration of Conflict**           | [Estimate: e.g., 20 minutes]                                                                |
| **Core Topic (The Surface Issue)** | [What you were *actually* arguing about: e.g., the dishes, the budget, a late text message] |
| **Pre-Conflict State**             | [One sentence on the mood *before* the trigger: e.g., Tired, Stressed, Calm]                |

## 2. Mandatory Data Mapping (For Analysis Engine)

This section mandates data crucial for the **Triage Engine** to select and run the
correct analysis prompts (PVT, IFS, NVC).

### A. PVT State Check (Regulation Status) 🚦

- **My State at Trigger:** [Estimate my nervous system state when the conflict *began*:
  **Ventral Vagal** (Calm), **Sympathetic** (Angry/Anxious), or **Dorsal Vagal**
  (Frozen/Numb)?]
- **Partner's State at Trigger (Observation):** [Estimate partner's observed state:
  **Ventral Vagal**, **Sympathetic**, or **Dorsal Vagal**?]
- **Safety Status:** [Did I feel physically or emotionally unsafe at any point?
  (Yes/No)]

### B. IFS Part Naming (Internal Structure) 🤔

- **My Part Name:** [What specific **Protector Part** took over my actions? (e.g., The
  Critic, The Pleaser, The Silent Withdrawer)]
- **My Part's Positive Intent:** [What was that Part trying to _protect_ me from? (e.g
