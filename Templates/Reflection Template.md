# üßò Personal Reflection Template

> **Purpose:** A structured template for self-guided, non-judgmental analysis of personal emotional and somatic responses immediately following a relational interaction or conflict.

---

## üìù The Event

- Briefly describe the conversation or interaction that triggered the need for reflection.

## üå° Emotional Map (The Polyvagal Lens)

- What emotions were present?
- Where did you feel them in your body? (Use **[[Polyvagal_Theory_PVT]]** language: e.g., feeling tension in the chest (Sympathetic), collapse in the shoulders (Dorsal Vagal), or flow (Ventral Vagal))

## üí° Core Insights (IFS & ACT Lens)

- What belief or assumption drove your behavior? (Use **[[Acceptance and Commitment Therapy]]** language: e.g., "I fused with the thought that I was being abandoned.")
- What internal **[[Internal_Family_Systems]] (IFS)** Part took the lead? (e.g., Critical Manager, Frightened Exile, Controlling Firefighter)
- What was the core need (**[[Nonviolent_Communication]] (NVC)**) you were fighting for? (e.g., Safety, Autonomy, Belonging, Rest)

## ‚û°Ô∏è Next Action

- What is one small, **values-driven action** you can commit to next? (Action should move you closer to your core values, not away from discomfort.)

### ## üìå Usage and Execution Notes

- **Intended Output:** A clear, non-judgmental map of personal nervous system states, protective parts, and core unmet needs.
- **Target User:** The individual immediately after a conflict cool-down or dysregulation event.
- **Fill-in Method:** **Use concise, first-person "I" statements.** The process is one of non-judgmental observation (**Self-energy**), not problem-solving or formulating a partner response. Focus on internal experience only.
