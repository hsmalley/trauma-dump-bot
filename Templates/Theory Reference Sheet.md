### B. IFS Alignment (Internal Structure)

- How does this framework view the internal experience of the user? Which concepts align with the **[[Internal Family Systems (IFS)]]** concepts of **Parts** (Protectors/Exiles)?

## 4. Neurodivergent & Complex Considerations

- **Neurodivergent Considerations:** How might this framework's tools need to be adapted for individuals with differences in processing, sensory input, or social communication?
- **ENM/Non-Traditional Structure Considerations:** How must the core principles be adapted or applied differently in non-monogamous or non-traditional family structures?
