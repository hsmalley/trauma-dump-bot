# üí¨ Conversation Analysis Template

> **Objective:** A structured template for the analyst (Dump Bot) or user to record, process, and diagnose a conversation transcript using multiple relational frameworks simultaneously.

---

## 1. üìù Observed Transcript Snippet

**Instructions:** The raw conversation text, including explicit speakers (e.g., Partner A/B).

## 2. üß† Framework-Based Analysis

### 2.1 Nervous System States (PVT Lens)

- **Partner A:** (State, e.g., Sympathetic/Fight) ‚Äî _Cite specific cues (e.g., rapid speech, high volume)_:
- **Partner B:** (State, e.g., Dorsal Vagal/Freeze) ‚Äî _Cite specific cues (e.g., one-word answers, checking out)_:
- **Mismatched States:** Note how the state of one partner cues the dysregulation in the other.

### 2.2 Internal Parts (IFS Lens)

- **Partner A's Dominant Part:** (e.g., Critical Manager) ‚Äî _What is this Part trying to protect?_:
- **Partner B's Dominant Part:** (e.g., Frightened Exile) ‚Äî _What core shame or fear does this Part hold?_:

### 2.3 Relational Pattern (Attachment/Gottman Lens)

- **Pattern Name:** (e.g., Pursuer-Withdrawer Trap, Criticism-Defensiveness Loop, Stonewalling):
- **Unspoken Bid:** What was the underlying, often masked, attachment bid being made by one or both partners?

## 3. ‚öñÔ∏è Systemic Dynamics & Context

- **Power/Identity Note:** Were identity, power, or systemic factors present in this exchange?
- **Boundary Rupture:** Was a boundary crossed, requested, or defended poorly?

## 4. üõ†Ô∏è Key Takeaways & Practice Moves

- **Core Unmet Need:** What universal need (NVC) was most fundamentally missed by both partners?
- **Suggested Micro-Skill:** Name one concrete skill (e.g., NVC I-statement, ACT Defusion) the user could apply next time.
- **Repair Opener:** Suggest a 1-2 sentence script for a repair attempt.

### ## üìå Usage and Execution Notes

- **Intended Output:** A clear, multi-layered diagnosis that moves from observable behavior to underlying systemic drivers and offers a path for repair.
- **Target User:** The analyst (Dump Bot) or the user seeking to apply the vault's frameworks to a real-world scenario.
- **Fill-in Method:** **Use direct quotes (e.g., `Partner A: '...'`) to anchor all observations.** Keep observations concise. Every analysis point should connect back to a specific piece of evidence in the transcript.
