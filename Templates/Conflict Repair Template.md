# 🛠️ Conflict Repair Template

> **Purpose:** Use this template when approaching your partner for a repair
> conversation. This structure moves beyond a simple "I'm sorry" to ensure you address
> accountability, acknowledge the partner's pain, and commit to a specific, measurable
> future action.

## 1. Safety & Context Setting

- **When I Plan to Use This:** [Date and Time]
- **Safety Check:** [Am I Ventral Vagal (Calm) right now? If not, perform a grounding
  exercise.]
- **Opening Line (Consent Check):** [e.g., "I know we need to circle back to what
  happened. Are you open to hearing my repair attempt for two minutes right now?"]

## 2. The Repair Script (The 3-Part Mandate)

This is the script generated by the
**[[Utility Prompt - Safe Relational Feedback Synthesis]]**. Read it slowly, staying
regulated.

### PART A: Self-Accountability & Observation (The "I" Statement)

**Goal:** Own _my_ behavior, _my_ state, and the impact of _my_ actions without
justifying or blaming.

> **My Script:** "I want to take accountability for my side of the cycle. I noticed that
> when I felt overwhelmed, my **Protector Part** [Name the Part, e.g., The Critic] took
> over. My action of [Specific action, e.g., raising my voice/shutting down] created a
> specific, negative impact on you, and for that, I am sorry."

### PART B: Empathy & Core Wound Validation (Acknowledging their Pain)

**Goal:** Demonstrate that I have witnessed and understood their reaction, linking it to
their likely **Core Wound** or **Attachment Fear**.

> **My Script:** "When I did that, I imagine it must have triggered your deepest fear of
> [Name their likely core fear, e.g., being dismissed/being abandoned]. I can see how my
> action made you feel [Specific feeling, e.g., unsafe, unheard, minimized], and that
> was not my intent. Your feelings make sense."

### PART C: Committed Action & Future Request

**Goal:** Define the measurable, behavioral step I will take next time, and request
their support. This is the **[[Committed Action]]**.

> **My Script:** "Moving forward, my **Committed Action** is to [Specific, measurable >
>
> > action, e.g., use the time-out phrase before I escalate/ask for a hug instead of > >
> > withdrawing/not speak for 5 minutes after I feel triggered]. I plan to do this
> > because it aligns with my value of [e.g., connection/respect]. Is that something you
> > can witness me trying to do?"

## 3. Post-Repair Debrief

- **Partner's Response:** [Did the partner accept the repair? Did they need more
  validation?]
- **Next Maintenance Step:** [What is the next item to add to the
  **[[02_MASTER_EXECUTION_Accountability_Review]]** to ensure this skill is practiced?]
