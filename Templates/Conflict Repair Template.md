## Template

```markdown
**1. Acknowledgment of Impact**

"I want to acknowledge that when I [describe action or behavior], it had an impact on you. I imagine that might have felt [guess feelings], and that wasn’t my intention."

**2. Naming My Own Experience (without blame)**

"When that happened, I was feeling [your feelings] and part of me was trying to [protect, express, manage something]."

**3. Listening for Understanding**

"I’d really like to understand more about what that was like for you. What felt most painful or difficult?"

**4. Naming the Pattern (if relevant)**

"I notice this kind of thing happens when [describe recurring dynamic]. I want to interrupt that cycle."

**5. Offering Repair**

"Would it help if I [offer specific action, check-in, structural change]?"

**6. Reaffirming Care and Choice**

"I care about you and want us to feel safe with each other. I respect whatever pace or boundary you need right now."
