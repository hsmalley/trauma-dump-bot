# _GLOSSARY OF TERMS

*Concise, relational definitions for technical terms and acronyms used across the vault. Each entry is written in a trauma-informed, non-judgmental voice and includes a pointer to [[Theory Reference Sheet]] for deeper context.*

### ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy)
A behaviorally oriented therapeutic model that emphasizes accepting difficult internal experiences while committing to values-driven actions; in relationships it frames how partners can act toward shared values even when emotions are uncomfortable. See [[Theory Reference Sheet]].

### Attachment (attachment patterns)
Relational styles developed across caregiving history (commonly described as secure, anxious, avoidant, or disorganized) that shape bids for connection, protest behaviors, and repair strategies in close relationships. See [[Theory Reference Sheet]].

### Cognitive fusion
A process where thoughts are experienced as literal truth and drive behavior; in couples work fusion can make reactive interpretations feel like facts, reducing curiosity and increasing conflict. See [[Theory Reference Sheet]].

### Committed action
A core ACT concept meaning intentional, values-guided behavior; in relational practice it describes following through on agreed-upon relationship practices even when difficult. See [[Theory Reference Sheet]].

### Co-regulation
The mutual process by which people use cues (tone, touch, pacing) to calm or energize one another’s nervous systems; foundational for repair, safety, and effective bids. See [[Theory Reference Sheet]].

### Consent (sexual & relational consent)
A clear, informed, and voluntary agreement to an interaction or outcome; in relational contexts consent is ongoing, specific, and revocable, and it includes checking about emotional as well as physical boundaries. See [[Theory Reference Sheet]].

### Double Empathy Problem
The mutual difficulty of understanding between people from different neurotypes or cultural frames; highlights that communication breakdowns are often reciprocal rather than one-sided deficits. See [[Theory Reference Sheet]].

### Dorsal vagal (state)
A Polyvagal-related shutdown state marked by low energy and disconnection; relationally it can look like withdrawal, dissociation, or flattened affect and requires gentle activation and safety cues to re-engage. See [[Theory Reference Sheet]].

### ENM (Ethical Non-Monogamy)
A set of relationship agreements where multiple partners are engaged with informed consent and negotiated boundaries; communication norms and scheduling are central relational tools in ENM. See [[Theory Reference Sheet]].

### Exile (IFS term)
A vulnerable, often painful part in IFS that holds unmet needs or traumatic memories; relational work helps partners notice when exile-driven responses are influencing interaction and invite compassionate curiosity. See [[Theory Reference Sheet]].

### Experiential avoidance
Attempts to avoid or suppress unwanted internal experiences (feelings, memories, urges); inside relationships this can create distance or shut down opportunities for repair when difficult emotions are ignored. See [[Theory Reference Sheet]].

### Four Horsemen
Gottman’s four interactional patterns—criticism, contempt, defensiveness, stonewalling—linked to escalating relational deterioration; useful as labels for behavior patterns to interrupt and replace with repair moves. See [[Theory Reference Sheet]].

### IFS Parts (Managers, Firefighters, Exiles)
A parts taxonomy: **Managers** try to prevent pain through control or perfectionism, **Firefighters** react impulsively to numb or distract, and **Exiles** hold vulnerability; mapping parts helps partners decouple reactive behavior from core values. See [[Theory Reference Sheet]].

### Neuroception
A Polyvagal concept describing unconscious nervous-system detection of safety or threat; in interactions it explains rapid shifts in tone or posture that precede conscious interpretation. See [[Theory Reference Sheet]].

### NVC (Nonviolent Communication)
A communication method structured as Observation → Feeling → Need → Request, used to translate reactive language into actionable, need-focused dialogue in relationships. See [[Theory Reference Sheet]].

### PEP (Post-Exposure Prophylaxis)
A time-sensitive medical regimen taken after potential HIV exposure; relationally relevant as an urgent health action that often requires rapid, non-judgmental communication and practical support. See [[Theory Reference Sheet]].

### Polyvagal Theory (PVT)
A model of autonomic organization emphasizing ventral vagal (social engagement), sympathetic (mobilization), and dorsal vagal (shutdown) circuits; it informs pacing, co-regulation, and trauma-informed interaction design. See [[Theory Reference Sheet]].

### PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis)
A preventative medication taken by HIV-negative individuals to reduce risk of HIV acquisition; in relational planning it factors into negotiated safety practices and ongoing sexual health conversations. See [[Theory Reference Sheet]].

### RACK (Risk-Aware Consensual Kink)
A harm-reduction consent framework in kink communities that emphasizes informed acknowledgement of risk and negotiated safety rather than assuming zero risk. See [[Theory Reference Sheet]].

### Safeword / Signal
A pre-agreed verbal or nonverbal cue used to pause or stop an interaction; in high-intensity relational scenes or negotiations it preserves agency and creates clear, immediate repair boundaries. See [[Theory Reference Sheet]].

### Self (IFS Self)
In IFS the Self is the grounded, compassionate center capable of leadership and curiosity; cultivating Self-presence in relationships supports nonreactive listening and repair. See [[Theory Reference Sheet]].

### Stonewalling
A behavior of shutting down or withdrawing during conflict (often linked to dorsal vagal responses); relational interventions focus on pausing, resourcing, and planned re-engagement rather than escalation. See [[Theory Reference Sheet]].

### Ventral vagal (state)
The social-engagement nervous-system state associated with safety, facial expressivity, and prosocial voice tone; relationally it supports connection, attunement, and effective repair. See [[Theory Reference Sheet]].
