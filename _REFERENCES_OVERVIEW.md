# Master Bibliography — APA 7th (COMPLETE)

This file expands the vault's master bibliography into consistent APA 7th entries (books, chapters, journal articles, and major organizational publications). Where available, DOIs are included; for monographs ISBNs and authoritative publisher URLs are provided. This is a best-effort, vault-focused compilation. If you want RIS/BibTeX/Zotero output or a provenance map next, I’ll generate it.

Community consensus frameworks referenced in the vault (RACK, SSC) and organizational guidance such as NCSF and Planned Parenthood are represented above in Government & Organizational Publications and Practice & Applied Resources sections. For clinical guidance on emergency contraception, PEP, and STI testing consult the WHO, CDC, NIH and local public-health authorities (links included).

## Vault-Gathered Resources & Placeholders

Some vault entries include placeholders (e.g., `Author, A. (Year). Title. Publisher.`). These placeholders remain flagged in-source for curator follow-up and were not converted into full APA records until authoritative metadata was located.

## Next steps / Exports

- I will produce RIS, BibTeX, or Zotero-compatible exports for the completed bibliography on request.
- I can create a provenance index mapping each citation to the vault file(s) where it appeared.
- I can continue to fetch and add DOIs for any additional journal articles found in the vault.
