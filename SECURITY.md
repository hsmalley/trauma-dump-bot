# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I'll try to address security reports asap. But I'm just a guy doing this for fun

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please contact me

- Description of the issue
- Reproduction steps or proof of concept
- Impact assessment (what could an attacker do?)
- Let me know if you want to fix it so we can setup a PR
