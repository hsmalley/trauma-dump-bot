# ü´Ç Analysis Prompt - Ethical Non-Monogamy (ENM) Assessment

> **Task:** Conduct a focused analysis of a relational issue or conflict within an
> Ethically Non-Monogamous (ENM) structure (e.g., polyamory, open relationship). The
> analysis must evaluate the integrity of **agreements** and **boundaries**, and map the
> conflict back to core **attachment needs** within the context of **complex
> relationship structures**.

---

### üíª Workflow

1.  **Identify Structure (Action):** Determine the relationship structure (e.g.,
    V-structure, kitchen table, parallel polyamory). This informs the complexity of the
    dynamics.
2.  **Agreement Audit (Action 3):** Check the transcript/context against the established
    relationship agreements (e.g., safer sex, time allocation, veto power). Were the
    agreements clear, explicit, and mutually agreed upon?
3.  **Boundary Integrity (Action 3):** Identify any boundary ruptures. Was the conflict
    about a partner violating a boundary, or a partner struggling to enforce a boundary?
4.  **Emotional Mapping (Action 3):** Map the conflict back to **[[Attachment Theory]]**
    fears: Was the anxiety triggered by fear of abandonment (Anxious) or fear of
    engulfment/loss of control (Avoidant)?
5.  **Hinge Dynamics:** If applicable (V-structure), evaluate the communication role of
    the **Hinge Partner**. Were they processing both sides of the conflict equitably, or
    bottlenecking communication?
6.  **Resource Allocation:** Check for equitable distribution of time, energy, and
    emotional labor (EAL) across the relationship matrix.
7.  **Synthesis and Feedback:** Provide specific, actionable feedback focused on
    improving **Negotiation** and **Nonviolent Communication (NVC)** clarity.

## üìö Frameworks Referenced

The analysis relies on the following frameworks, sorted by primary relevance:

1.  **[[Attachment Theory]]** (Primary Relevance): Critical for analyzing insecurity
    (e.g., jealousy, anxiety) triggered by external relationships; the need for
    reassurance is often heightened.
2.  **[[Nonviolent Communication]]**: Essential for analyzing clarity in boundary
    setting, distinguishing a _request_ from a _demand_, and translating jealousy into
    an unmet **need**.
3.  **[[Polyvagal Theory]]**: Used to analyze emotional flooding related to boundary
    violations or insecurity, reframing the distress as a somatic nervous system
    response.
4.  **Consent Culture/EOC (Enthusiastic Ongoing Consent)**: Used to audit the
    relationship's ethical foundation‚Äînot just sexual, but regarding time and emotional
    commitments.
5.  **Relationship Anarchy (RA)**: Used to evaluate relationships that intentionally
    eschew hierarchy, focusing on individual autonomy and fluid agreements.

## üìà Use Cases (Action 4)

| Use Case                                    | When to Apply                                                                                       | Evidence-Based Suggestion                                                                                           |
| :------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **New Relationship Energy (NRE) Spillover** | When a new partner causes distress or strain in an existing relationship (NRE is a common trigger). | The analysis should audit the time/energy allocation agreement to restore stability to the primary relationship(s). |
| **Boundary Renegotiation**                  | When an established agreement needs to be changed due to unforeseen emotional needs.                | Focus on the **[[Nonviolent Communication]]** lens to ensure the new boundary is stated as a need, not a demand.    |
| **Managing Compersion/Jealousy**            | When a partner is struggling with compersion (joy for a partner's joy) and instead feels distress.  | Map the distress to the **[[Attachment Theory]]** fear to address the root insecurity, not just the symptom.        |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Concerns (Action 6)

- **Ethical Concern:** The analysis risks **Mononormative Bias**‚Äîassuming distress is
  inherently a failure of the ENM structure rather than a normal emotional challenge.
- **Constraint:** The analysis **MUST** explicitly affirm the validity of the ENM
  structure. All distress must be framed as a natural, non-pathological experience
  requiring improved communication or boundary renegotiation, not a signal to abandon
  the structure.
