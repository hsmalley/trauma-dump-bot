# 🔍 Analysis Prompt - Protector/Manager Audit

> **Task:** Conduct an internal audit of the transcript using the **[[Internal Family Systems (IFS)]]** lens. The analysis must identify the specific **Protector Part(s)** active during the conflict, determine their **positive intent**, and assess the degree to which the user was **blended** or acting from **Self-energy**. The goal is to separate the person from the protective behavior.

---

### 💻 Workflow

1.  **Part Identification (Action):** Identify the specific type of **Protector Part** speaking for the user (and ideally the partner) during the conflict:
    - **Manager:** (Proactive/Controlling: e.g., The Critic, The Pleaser, The Planner).
    - **Firefighter:** (Reactive/Desperate: e.g., The Addict, The Distractor, The Rager).
2.  **Blended State Diagnosis:** Determine the user's primary state. Was the user **blended** with the Part (i.e., _being_ the Part) or acting from **Self-energy** (i.e., _observing_ the Part)? Use quotes from the transcript as evidence.
3.  **Positive Intent Audit (Action 3):** Articulate the **positive intent** of the most dominant Part. What was it desperately trying to prevent from happening to the system or the relationship? (e.g., "The Critic Part was trying to prevent the Exile from feeling like a failure.")
4.  **Relational Cost Assessment:** Analyze the cost of the Part's action. How did the Protector's behavior (which was aimed at keeping the user safe) inadvertently **trigger** the partner's own **[[Attachment Theory]]** fears?
5.  **Self-Energy Action (Action 3):** Provide a clear, immediate action the user could take next time to access **Self-energy** instead of blending with the Part.
6.  **Synthesis and Micro-Skill:** Summarize the Part's function and provide the **[[Internal Family Systems (IFS)]]** micro-skill of **Unblending** as the primary intervention.

1.  **[[Internal Family Systems (IFS)]] (Primary)**: Provides the core terminology and methodology for Parts work (Protector, Manager, Firefighter, Self).
2.  **[[Analysis Prompt - Exile_Core Wound Mapping]] (Implicit)**: Used to define the _target_ of the Protector's defense.
3.  **[[Acceptance and Commitment Therapy]]**: Used to reinforce the idea that the Part's _action_ contradicts the user's core _values_.

| **Chronic Self-Criticism** | When the user frequently blames themselves or takes too much responsibility.                                                                  | Targets the **Inner Critic** Manager Part, transforming self-blame into an observation of protective intent.       |
| **Emotional Overreaction** | When the response is sudden, aggressive, or involves an immediate shift to a destructive behavior (e.g., substance use, rage, shutting down). | Targets the **Firefighter** Part, identifying the immediate, painful trigger it was trying to suppress.            |
| **Inability to Apologize** | When one partner stays highly defensive and cannot access vulnerability.                                                                      | Targets the **Shame Protector** or **Defender** Manager Part, providing language to separate from the Part's fear. |
