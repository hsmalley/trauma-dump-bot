# ‚öîÔ∏è Analysis Prompt - Multi-Modal Conflict Assessment

> **Task:** Conduct a full, multi-layered analysis of a provided conversation transcript. The analysis must integrate the **relational cycle**, **attachment needs**, and **somatic responses** to provide a complete, trauma-informed assessment of the conflict and offer actionable paths for repair.

---

### üíª Workflow

1.  **Identify Core Cycle (Action 1):** Determine the primary negative relational pattern (e.g., Pursue-Withdraw).
2.  **Somatic Mapping (Action 3):** For both partners, identify the likely **[[Polyvagal_Theory_PVT]]** state (Ventral Vagal, Sympathetic, Dorsal Vagal) driving their verbal and non-verbal cues.
3.  **Core Need Mapping (Action 3):** Identify the underlying **[[Attachment Theory]]** need (e.g., Closeness, Autonomy, Security) being expressed or violated.
4.  **Communication Failures (Action 3):** Point out explicit **[[Gottman Method]]** "Four Horsemen" behaviors or **[[Nonviolent Communication]]** failures (demands vs. requests).
5.  **Internal Framing (Action 3):** Briefly frame the most intense behavior as a protective "Part" (**[[Internal Family Systems]]**), highlighting the fear it is protecting.
6.  **Synthesis and Repair:** Synthesize findings into clear, non-blaming insights and provide concrete micro-skill recommendations for future repair.

## üìö Frameworks Referenced

The analysis relies on the following frameworks, sorted by primary relevance:

1.  **[[Attachment Theory]]** (Primary Relevance): Provides the fundamental lens for understanding core needs and fears driving the cycle.
2.  **[[Polyvagal Theory]]**: Essential for mapping the **somatic** experience of conflict, reframing "overreaction" as "nervous system response."
3.  **[[Gottman Method]]**: Provides clear, observable labels for conflict behaviors (e.g., Criticism, Defensiveness) to structure the analysis.
4.  **[[Internal Family Systems]]**: Used to shift the focus from "bad person" to "protective part," increasing compassion.
5.  **[[Nonviolent Communication]]**: Essential for translating conflict statements into actionable requests and universal needs.

## üìà Use Cases (Action 4)

| Use Case                    | When to Apply                                                                                                                    | Evidence-Based Suggestion                                                                                                                                      |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Comprehensive Diagnosis** | When a detailed, holistic understanding of a chronic or severe conflict is needed.                                               | The multi-modal approach prevents analysis from getting stuck on single issues (like just communication) by integrating body, emotion, and relational history. |
| **Therapeutic Triage**      | To quickly identify the most effective intervention point (somatic regulation, communication skills, or attachment reassurance). | If the PVT state is Dorsal Vagal, somatic regulation (PVT) is needed before any cognitive (Gottman) work can succeed.                                          |
| **Education and Empathy**   | To help both partners see their behavior as a predictable response to system distress, not a character flaw.                     | By naming the cycle, the partners gain a shared map and can start working together against the pattern.                                                        |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Concerns (Action 6)

- **Ethical Concern:** The complexity of a multi-modal analysis can be overwhelming or lead to "analysis paralysis" if presented without a clear, prioritizing summary.
- **Constraint:** The analysis **MUST** start and end with a **single, clear, non-blaming summary** that contextualizes the complex findings in simple terms (e.g., "This conflict is driven by a mismatch in your core need for closeness (Partner A) and space (Partner B), exacerbated by sympathetic nervous system activation.").
