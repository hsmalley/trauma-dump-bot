# üå± Analysis Prompt - Values & Goals Alignment (ACT Lens)

> **Task:** Conduct an analysis of a relationship based on the principles of
> **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)**. The analysis must identify the partners'
> stated and implicit **core values** and diagnose the degree of **Psychological
> Flexibility** (or lack thereof) in their day-to-day actions, identifying areas of
> **Fusion** and **Avoidance**.

### üíª Workflow (The ACT Hexaflex)

1.  **Values Clarification (Action):** Identify the core
    **[[Acceptance and Commitment Therapy]]** values of each partner (e.g., Honesty,
    Adventure, Safety, Growth) as expressed in their words and actions.
2.  **Fusion Audit (Action 3):** Identify instances of **Cognitive Fusion** in the
    transcript‚Äîwhere a partner is treating a thought or story (e.g., "I am always
    right," "I am a failure") as an absolute truth.
3.  **Avoidance Audit (Action 3):** Identify instances of **Experiential
    Avoidance**‚Äîwhere partners are avoiding necessary but painful emotions (e.g.,
    shutting down during tough talks to avoid anxiety, avoiding necessary conflict to
    maintain false peace).
4.  **Action Gap Analysis:** Compare the identified **Values** to the observed
    **Actions**. Is there a significant gap? (e.g., Value is _Connection_, but action is
    _Withdrawal_).
5.  **Identify Stuckness:** Determine the core **[[Internal Family Systems]]** Part or
    emotional burden that is preventing **Committed Action** aligned with values.
6.  **Synthesis and Micro-Skill:** Synthesize the analysis to explain how the
    _relational system_ is stuck due to _shared_ avoidance, and suggest one **Defusion**
    or **Mindfulness** micro-skill.

## üìö Frameworks Referenced

The analysis relies on the following frameworks, sorted by primary relevance:

1.  **[[Acceptance and Commitment Therapy]]** (Primary Relevance): Provides the
    foundation for auditing values, fusion, and committed action. The core diagnostic
    tool.
2.  **[[Nonviolent Communication]]**: Used to simplify complex emotional drivers into
    universal human needs/values (e.g., Freedom, Autonomy, Security).
3.  **[[Internal Family Systems]]**: Useful for framing **fusion** as a protective
    strategy of a **Part** (e.g., the Criticizing Part fuses with the thought "You are a
    disaster" to motivate change).
4.  **[[Polyvagal Theory]]**: Used to ground **Experiential Avoidance** in the somatic
    reality of the nervous system (avoiding Ventral Vagal shutdown).

## üìà Use Cases (Action 4)

| Use Case                | When to Apply                                                                                     | Evidence-Based Suggestion                                                                                                                    |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Relational Drift**    | When partners report feeling "stuck" or that the relationship is "flat," despite low conflict.    | The analysis targets **Psychological Flexibility**‚Äîthe ability to act in line with values even when experiencing pain‚Äîto re-engage vitality. |
| **Chronic Avoidance**   | When necessary, tough conversations are continuously postponed or derailed by emotional flooding. | Pinpoints the specific thoughts/emotions partners are avoiding, allowing for targeted **Acceptance** and **Defusion** work.                  |
| **Pre-Commitment Work** | Before major relational agreements (e.g., moving in, marriage, ENM agreements).                   | Ensures both partners have explicit, shared values that will guide their complex decision-making.                                            |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Concerns (Action 6)

- **Ethical Concern:** ACT's focus on "Acceptance" can be misconstrued as promoting
  acceptance of abusive or harmful relational conditions.
- **Constraint:** The analysis **MUST** state that **Committed Action** involves taking
  steps to **protect one's safety and well-being**, which may include ending a damaging
  cycle or relationship. Acceptance is of _internal pain_, not _external abuse_.
