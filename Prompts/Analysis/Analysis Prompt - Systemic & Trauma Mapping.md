# üèõÔ∏è Analysis Prompt - Systemic & Trauma Mapping

> **Task:** Conduct an advanced analysis of a high-conflict or chronically stuck dynamic by mapping the current issue onto the **systemic context** and **trauma history** of each partner. The goal is to identify and separate the conflict caused by **re-enactment** (old pain) from the conflict caused by **relational disagreement** (present issue).

---

### üíª Workflow

1.  **Map External Pressures (Action):** Identify and list 3-5 external stressors (financial, cultural, sociopolitical, racial, illness, family demands) that are currently exerting pressure on the relational system.
2.  **Identify Trauma Re-enactment:** Analyze the current conflict for patterns that directly mirror or re-enact a trauma from the past (e.g., current control issues mirroring childhood helplessness).
3.  **IFS Trauma Mapping (Action 3):** For the most intense moments, identify the **[[Internal Family Systems]]** **Exile** (wounded child part) and **Burden** (shame, terror) driving the over-the-top protective behavior (**Protector**).
4.  **Systemic Rule Audit:** Identify any unspoken **Family-of-Origin Rules** being re-enacted (e.g., "Don't talk about money," "The woman is responsible for emotional labor").
5.  **Somatic Trauma Check (Action 3):** Use **[[Polyvagal Theory]]** to confirm if the reaction was a **trauma response** (flashback, collapse, dissociation) rather than a simple emotional outburst.
6.  **Reframing:** Synthesize findings into a single statement that reframes the conflict not as a _relational_ failure but as a _systemic_ squeeze or a _historical trauma_ spillover.

## üìö Frameworks Referenced

The analysis relies on the following frameworks, sorted by primary relevance:

1.  **[[Internal Family Systems]]** (Primary Relevance): Essential for identifying the **historical source** of the emotional intensity (Exiles/Burden) and separating the wounded self from the functioning self.
2.  **Systems Theory (Implicit)**: Provides the core principle that the conflict is a function of the entire environment and system, not just the two people.
3.  **[[Polyvagal Theory]]**: Critical for trauma-informed analysis, confirming if extreme reactions are biologically necessary survival responses, not manipulative behavior.
4.  **[[Attachment Theory]]**: Used to map **relational trauma** (e.g., disorganized attachment) to current unpredictable/fearful behavior.

## üìà Use Cases (Action 4)

| Use Case                          | When to Apply                                                                                | Evidence-Based Suggestion                                                                                                                              |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chronic, Intractable Conflict** | When simple communication or conflict resolution skills fail to resolve the issue.           | The analysis is needed when the solution is **outside** the couple's current dynamic (i.e., changing systemic pressures or healing historical wounds). |
| **High-Intensity Reactions**      | When one partner's reaction is vastly disproportionate to the event (a **trauma reaction**). | The IFS/PVT mapping separates the _Part's_ reaction from the _Person's_ intent, restoring **Self-energy** and reducing shame.                          |
| **Generational Patterns**         | When the couple is repeating an unhealthy pattern seen in their family of origin.            | Provides the map needed to consciously **differentiate** from inherited relational rules.                                                              |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Concerns (Action 6)

- **Ethical Concern:** The analysis risks engaging in "armchair trauma diagnosis" or using past trauma to excuse present harmful behavior.
- **Constraint:** The analysis **MUST** maintain a **trauma-informed and Self-led** stance. The goal is to provide **compassion for the Part/Wound**, while maintaining **accountability for the adult action**. The analysis must never assign the label of "abuse" or "diagnosis."
