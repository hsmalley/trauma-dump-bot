# ðŸŒ€ Analysis Prompt - Dissociation & Fragmentation Check

> **Task:** Conduct an immediate safety audit by screening the transcript for indicators of **Dissociation, Fragmentation, or Dorsal Vagal Shutdown**. The analysis must prioritize identifying signs that one or both partners were psychologically "absent" during the interaction. The primary goal is to determine if the next action should be **immediate self-regulation and grounding**, rather than continued analysis or relational repair.

### ðŸ’» Workflow

1.  **Dorsal Vagal Indicator Audit (Action):** Scan the transcript for linguistic signs of **Shutdown/Collapse** (PVT):
    - **Linguistic:** One-word answers, complete silence, statements of extreme hopelessness, or expressions of physical fatigue ("I can't move," "I don't care," "My mind went blank").
    - **Behavioral Inference:** Sudden loss of memory regarding the previous minute of conversation or statements that indicate mental detachment ("I feel like I'm watching this from above").
2.  **Fragmentation/Parts Loss Check:** Look for indications of **fragmentation** (loss of access to information or time):
    - Was there a severe, sudden shift in personality or tone that cannot be explained by escalation alone (a **Part** leaving abruptly)?
    - Did the user state they have _no memory_ of how a core event started or finished?
3.  **Safety Compromise Assessment (Action 3):** Determine if the observed dissociation was a defense mechanism against an overwhelming threat (an **Exile trigger**). If so, was the threat internal or external?
4.  **Immediate Action Mandate (Action 3):** If clear signs of dissociation or Dorsal Vagal are present, immediately interrupt the analysis and issue a **Safety Mandate**.
5.  **Synthesis and Micro-Skill:** Provide a summary of the state and recommend the specific **[[Polyvagal Theory]] micro-skill** of **Grounding and Orientation** as the primary intervention before _any_ further relational work is attempted.

## ðŸ“š Frameworks Referenced

1.  **[[Polyvagal Theory]] (Primary)**: Provides the core framework for understanding Dorsal Vagal shutdown and the biological need for safety/grounding.
2.  **[[Analysis Prompt - Systemic & Trauma Mapping]]**: Used to infer that the dissociation is likely linked to a past trauma response being re-enacted.
3.  **[[_CORE_PRINCIPLES_AND_GOVERNANCE]] (Mandatory)**: Enforces the "Regulation First" and "Safety Over Analysis" rule.

| **Complete Shut-Down** | When one partner appears physically or verbally unresponsive, despite a high-stakes conversation.       | Targets the biological imperative to disconnect, forcing a cessation of communication.                    |
| **"Blanking Out"**     | When the user reports a loss of memory or confusion regarding the timeline of events.                   | Acknowledges the dissociation and mandates a return to a safe, regulated state before recall is expected. |
| **Systemic Overwhelm** | When multiple severe threats (PVT and Exile triggers) are present, resulting in a flight from the self. | Reinforces the need to establish _individual_ stability before attempting _dyadic_ stability.             |
