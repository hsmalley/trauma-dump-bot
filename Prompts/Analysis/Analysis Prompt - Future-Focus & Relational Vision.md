# ‚ú® Analysis Prompt - Future-Focus & Relational Vision

> **Task:** Conduct an audit focused on the relationship's forward momentum. The
> analysis must determine the degree of **alignment** between the partners' individual
> and shared **long-term goals** (vision), assess the **feasibility** of these goals,
> and audit current actions against the desired future using the
> **[[Acceptance and Commitment Therapy]] (ACT)** lens.

### üíª Workflow

1. **Vision Audit (Action):** Identify and list the partners' explicit and implicit
   long-term relational goals (e.g., lifestyle, family, financial, retirement).
2. **Alignment Check (Action 3):** Determine if the "Shared Vision" is genuinely
   **mutual** and **values-driven**, or if it is merely one partner's dream being
   accommodated or **Experientially Avoided** by the other.
3. **Feasibility Audit:** Using a **Systems Theory** lens, check the feasibility of the
   goals against current resources: Are the financial/time/energy commitments realistic?
   Is the plan overly reliant on **Avoidance** strategies?
4. **Behavioral Gap Analysis (Action 3):** Audit a recent action or communication
   snippet against the **Shared Vision**. Does the current behavior move the couple
   **toward** the vision (Committed Action) or **away** from the vision (Avoidance)?
5. **Identify Bottlenecks:** Pinpoint the single most significant **obstacle** to
   achieving the shared goal (e.g., lack of **[[Boundary Models]]**, **Cognitive
   Fusion** with limiting beliefs).
6. **Synthesis and Micro-Skill:** Provide a clear, actionable **"Next Step"** that
   serves as a **Committed Action** moving the relationship closer to the **Shared
   Vision**.

## üìö Frameworks Referenced

The analysis relies on the following frameworks, sorted by primary relevance:

1. **[[Acceptance and Commitment Therapy]]** (Primary Relevance): Provides the essential
   lens for defining **Values** and auditing the **Behavioral Gap** between values and
   action (Committed Action).
2. **Systems Theory (Implicit)**: Used to audit the **feasibility** of goals, ensuring
   the vision works within the constraints of the shared system's resources (time,
   money, energy).
3. **[[Nonviolent Communication]]**: Used to clarify the **needs** and **requests**
   underlying the desired goals, transforming vague dreams into actionable steps.
4. **[[Analysis Prompt - Values & Goals Alignment (ACT Lens)]]**: Used as a foundational
   reference to ensure the core values are already clear before applying this prompt.

## üìà Use Cases (Action 4)

| Use Case                       | When to Apply                                                                                                                           | Evidence-Based Suggestion                                                                                                     |
| :----------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Relational Stagnation**      | When the relationship has low conflict but no exciting shared direction ("flatlining").                                                 | This tool **reintroduces vitality** by focusing energy on a mutually exciting and values-aligned future.                      |
| **Pre-Commitment Feasibility** | Before major life transitions (e.g., combining finances, having children, moving).                                                      | Audits the goals for **shared reality** and **systemic feasibility**, preventing future rupture from mismatched expectations. |
| **Ending Chronic Conflict**    | To re-direct energy away from **Experiential Avoidance** (fighting about small things) and toward **Committed Action** (shared vision). |                                                                                                                               |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Concerns (Action 6)

- **Ethical Concern:** The prompt risks prioritizing the **relationship's goals** over
  the **individual's autonomy**, pressuring a partner to conform to a shared vision they
  don't truly desire.
- **Constraint:** The analysis **MUST** explicitly state that **individual values are
  sovereign**. If a shared vision requires the suppression of a core individual value,
  the analysis must recommend renegotiation or a change in the relational vision.
