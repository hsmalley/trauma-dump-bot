# üíî Analysis Prompt - Exile/Core Wound Mapping

> **Task:** Conduct a deep diagnostic audit, using the
> **[[Internal Family Systems (IFS)]]** lens, to hypothesize the **Core Wound** or
> **Exile Part** that was triggered and defended during the conflict. The analysis must
> identify the root belief (e.g., "I am worthless") and assess how the partner's action
> unintentionally activated the user's deepest pain.

### üíª Workflow

1.  **Protector Link:** Reference the finding from the
    **[[Analysis Prompt - Protector_Manager Audit]]**. What specific **Protector Part**
    (Manager/Firefighter) was active?
2.  **Exile Hypothesis (Action):** Based on the Protector's _positive intent_,
    hypothesize the single, core **Exile Belief** that the Protector was fighting to
    hide or suppress.
    - _Example:_ If the Protector was **The Critic**, the Exile belief is likely: _‚ÄúI am
      fundamentally flawed/unlovable.‚Äù_
    - _Example:_ If the Protector was **The Pleaser**, the Exile belief is likely: _‚ÄúI
      will be abandoned if I set a boundary.‚Äù_
3.  **Core Wound Activation Audit (Action 3):** Pinpoint the exact word, phrase, or
    action in the transcript where the partner unintentionally **activated** this Exile.
    Was it a perceived glance, a tone of voice, or a single critical comment?
4.  **Historical Link Assessment:** Briefly assess if the Core Wound hypothesis aligns
    with known **[[Analysis Prompt - Systemic & Trauma Mapping]]** patterns (e.g.,
    repeating the shame felt by a family member).
5.  **Unburdening Potential:** Determine the next necessary step for **Unblending** and
    **Unburdening**. What specific **Self-energy** (Compassion, Curiosity) must the user
    bring to the Exile belief to begin the healing process?
6.  **Synthesis and Micro-Skill:** Provide a summary statement that connects the
    Protector's _behavior_ to the Exile's _pain_, offering the **IFS micro-skill** of
    **Witnessing** as the primary intervention.

## üìö Frameworks Referenced

1.  **[[Internal Family Systems (IFS)]] (Primary)**: Provides the core methodology for
    identifying Exiles and the process of Unburdening.
2.  **[[Analysis Prompt - Attachment Cycle Mapping]]**: Used to link the Exile belief
    (e.g., fear of abandonment) back to the relational cycle.
3.  **Trauma-Informed Practice (Implicit)**: Reinforces that the core wound is a
    consequence of overwhelming past experience, not a current failure.

## üìà Use Cases

| Use Case               | When to Apply                                                                                              | Evidence-Based Suggestion                                                                                                                |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Self-Sabotage**      | When the user creates conflict just as things get good, or pushes the partner away.                        | Targets the **Exile belief** that "Good things don't last," which is being preemptively protected by a self-destructive **Firefighter**. |
| **Overwhelming Shame** | When the user completely shuts down, cries uncontrollably, or cannot make eye contact after a minor error. | Targets the **Core Shame Exile**, helping the user understand the Part's attempt to disappear due to intense painful emotions.           |
| **Rigid Avoidance**    | When a partner refuses to talk about vulnerability or any deep emotions.                                   | Targets the **Exile** holding the belief that _vulnerability equals death/harm_, which is being rigidly protected by a **Manager**.      |
