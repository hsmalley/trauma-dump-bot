# ü©π Analysis Prompt - Relational Repair Attempts

> **Task:** Analyze a provided conversation transcript to specifically identify, categorize, and evaluate any instances of **relational repair attempts** (successful or unsuccessful). The analysis must determine why the attempt succeeded or failed and provide clear, actionable feedback for improvement.

---

### üíª Workflow

1.  **Identify Attempt (Action):** Locate all instances where a partner attempts to de-escalate, apologize, or shift the focus away from conflict (a "repair attempt").
2.  **Evaluate Effectiveness (Action 3):** Assess the attempt using **[[Gottman_Method]]** criteria (e.g., was it soothing, non-defensive, did it land?).
3.  **Analyze Content (Action 3):** Use **[[Nonviolent_Communication_NVC]]** to determine if the repair attempt contained a genuine apology, a statement of responsibility, or a clear articulation of an unmet need/request.
4.  **Identify Barrier (Action 3):** If the attempt **failed**, map the failure to the partner's **[[Attachment Theory]]** fear (e.g., the receiving partner was too flooded to accept the repair, or the offering partner's attempt was masked defensiveness).
5.  **Provide Feedback:** Generate 1-2 concrete sentences (a "micro-skill") that would have made the repair attempt more effective.

## üìö Frameworks Referenced

The analysis relies on the following frameworks, sorted by primary relevance:

1.  **[[Gottman_Method]]** (Primary Relevance): Provides the foundation for defining and assessing the success rate of a repair attempt (e.g., humor, physical touch, "I feel" statements).
2.  **[[Nonviolent_Communication_NVC]]**: Crucial for evaluating the _content_ of the attempt, ensuring it translates into an apology for **impact** rather than a defense of **intent**.
3.  **[[Attachment Theory]]**: Used to understand the underlying _motivation_ for both offering and rejecting repair bids (i.e., the need for relational safety and reassurance).
4.  **[[Polyvagal_Theory_PVT]]**: Essential for noting the timing; a repair attempt is often rejected if the receiving partner is in a Sympathetic or Dorsal Vagal state.

## üìà Use Cases (Action 4)

| Use Case                   | When to Apply                                                                        | Evidence-Based Suggestion                                                                                                        |
| :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Skill Building**         | When partners frequently fight but rarely resolve conflict or apologize effectively. | Directly targets and refines the most critical relationship skill: the ability to quickly de-escalate and reconnect.             |
| **Deconstructing Failure** | When one partner reports, "I apologized, but it didn't work."                        | This analysis separates the **intent** (the apology) from the **impact** (how it was received) to identify the specific barrier. |
| **Emotional Flooding**     | After a conflict where one or both partners were emotionally overwhelmed.            | The analysis can confirm that the failure was due to **emotional flooding** (PVT) rather than a lack of love or willingness.     |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Concerns (Action 6)

- **Ethical Concern:** A failed repair attempt can be incorrectly labeled as manipulative or unwilling.
- **Constraint:** The analysis must explicitly assume **benign intent** behind the repair attempt and frame failure as a **skill gap** or **nervous system incompatibility** (poor timing/flooding), rather than a moral failure.
