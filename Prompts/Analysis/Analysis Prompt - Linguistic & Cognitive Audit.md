# üó£Ô∏è Analysis Prompt - Linguistic & Cognitive Audit

> **Task:** Conduct a highly detailed analysis of a conversation transcript, focusing
> strictly on the **language, structure, and thought patterns** (cognition) used by the
> partners. The goal is to identify **Cognitive Distortions** and **Linguistic
> Ambiguity** that escalate conflict and prevent clear communication.

---

### üíª Workflow

1. **Identify Distortions (Action):** Systematically audit the transcript for common
   **Cognitive Distortions** (e.g., Catastrophizing, Emotional Reasoning, All-or-Nothing
   Thinking, Personalization).
2. **Audit Absolutes:** Specifically identify and list all **"always/never"** statements
   and highly rigid generalizations. These are key linguistic markers of cognitive
   fusion.
3. **Ambiguity Check (Action 3):** Check the language for ambiguity or passive voice.
   Were needs stated as vague generalities, or as clear, actionable
   **[[Nonviolent Communication]]** requests?
4. **Mind Reading Audit (Action 3):** Identify instances of **Mind Reading** (e.g., "I
   know you didn't _really_ mean that") and **Labeling** (e.g., "You're just being
   manipulative").
5. **Language Transformation (Action 3):** For a key distortion, demonstrate how the
   language could be **Defused** (ACT) or transformed into an **Observation** (NVC).
6. **Synthesis and Micro-Skill:** Provide a clear summary of the top 3 cognitive traps,
   and offer a specific **[[Acceptance and Commitment Therapy]]** micro-skill (like
   **Defusion**) to address the pattern.

## üìö Frameworks Referenced

The analysis relies on the following frameworks, sorted by primary relevance:

1. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) (Implicit)**: Provides the core framework for
   identifying and labeling the **Cognitive Distortions** (e.g., catastrophizing).
2. **[[Acceptance_and_Commitment_Therapy (ACT)]]**: Essential for providing the
   intervention‚Äî**Defusion**‚Äîwhich teaches partners to separate themselves from their
   language and thoughts.
3. **[[Nonviolent_Communication_NVC]]**: Used to transform distorted judgments and
   absolute language into observable facts and universal needs.
4. **Linguistics/Communication Theory**: Provides the lens for auditing clarity,
   ambiguity, and the use of passive voice versus assertive communication.

## üìà Use Cases (Action 4)

| Use Case                            | When to Apply                                                                                                                                                 | Evidence-Based Suggestion                                                                                                                 |
| :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Escalation Audit**                | When minor disagreements frequently turn into high-intensity, global arguments.                                                                               | The analysis shows that **cognitive distortions** (e.g., catastrophizing the future) are driving the disproportionate emotional response. |
| **Blame Audit**                     | When conflict is heavily focused on assigning blame or intent, rather than solving the problem.                                                               | Targets **Personalization** and **Mind Reading** as the cognitive drivers of defensive behavior.                                          |
| **Neurotypical/Neurodivergent Gap** | As a follow-up to the **[[Analysis Prompt - Neurodivergent Relationality Audit]]** to teach **explicit language** and reduce reliance on **implied meaning**. |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Concerns (Action 6)

- **Ethical Concern:** The prompt risks creating a cold, intellectual environment where
  emotions are dismissed as "just a cognitive distortion," invalidating genuine
  feelings.
- **Constraint:** The analysis **MUST** explicitly state that **feelings are real and
  valid**, but that **thoughts are not facts**. The goal of **Defusion** is to free the
  partner to act on their values, not to shame them for their feelings.
