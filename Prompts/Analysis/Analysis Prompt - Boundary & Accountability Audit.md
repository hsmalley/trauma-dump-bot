# üèõÔ∏è Analysis Prompt - Boundary & Accountability Audit

> **Task:** Conduct a structural analysis of a provided conflict or communication breakdown, focusing on the integrity of **boundaries** and the quality of **accountability**. The analysis must diagnose whether the problem is a failure of **structure** (unclear rules) or a failure of **follow-through** (broken promises/actions), providing specific feedback for improving relational governance.

---

### üíª Workflow

1.  **Boundary Clarity Audit (Action):** Identify the specific boundary at the core of the conflict (e.g., time, money, communication style, ENM agreements). Was the boundary **explicitly stated** and **mutually consented** to, or was it an unspoken assumption?
2.  **Violation vs. Unclarity:** Determine if the conflict resulted from a **Violation** (a known rule was broken) or **Unclarity** (a rule did not exist or was ambiguous).
3.  **Accountability Audit (Action 3):** If a repair attempt was made, evaluate its quality: Did the partner apologize for the **impact** (true accountability), or did they defend their **intent** (poor accountability)?
4.  **Committed Action Check (Action 3):** Use the **[[Acceptance and Commitment Therapy]] (ACT)** lens to audit the quality of the follow-through. Was the action a one-time apology, or was a concrete, repeatable step taken to prevent recurrence (a "Committed Action")?
5.  **Relational Governance Score:** Assign a high/medium/low score to the relationship's governance based on consistency of boundary enforcement and accountability success rate.
6.  **Synthesis and Micro-Skill:** Provide one specific boundary statement (e.g., using **[[Nonviolent Communication]]** format) and one **Committed Action** the partners should implement immediately.

## üìö Frameworks Referenced

The analysis relies on the following frameworks, sorted by primary relevance:

1.  **[[Consent Culture]]** (Primary Relevance): Provides the standard for auditing boundaries: Were they explicit, enthusiastic, and ongoing?
2.  **[[Acceptance and Commitment Therapy]] (ACT)**: Essential for auditing **Accountability** by checking for **Committed Action** (alignment between values and follow-through behavior).
3.  **[[Nonviolent Communication]]**: Used to translate soft boundaries or demands into clear, positive **requests** and needs.
4.  **[[Conflict Repair Template]]**: Used as a reference to determine if the repair attempt contained the necessary structural components (responsibility, empathy, future request).

## üìà Use Cases (Action 4)

| Use Case                 | When to Apply                                                                            | Evidence-Based Suggestion                                                                                    |
| :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chronic Conflict**     | When the same issue arises repeatedly, despite multiple apologies or agreements.         | The audit reveals that the core problem is a failure of **system structure**, not a lack of love or empathy. |
| **Integrity Issues**     | When one partner reports feeling unable to trust the other's promises or follow-through. | Shifts the analysis from emotional issues to measurable, actionable **behavioral commitments**.              |
| **Ambiguous Agreements** | For complex dynamics (e.g., ENM, co-parenting) where rules are assumed but not explicit. | Forces partners to articulate the "unwritten rules" and gain explicit, mutual **Consent** to them.           |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Concerns (Action 6)

- **Ethical Concern:** The prompt risks creating an overly legalistic or transactional tone, reducing the relationship to a set of contracts rather than an emotional bond.
- **Constraint:** The analysis **MUST** state that **Accountability** is an act of **care and security**, not punishment. The final feedback must integrate the importance of **softness and empathy** alongside the rigid boundary structure.
