# ‚õìÔ∏è Analysis Prompt - Kink & Power Dynamics Assessment

> **Task:** Conduct a focused analysis of a relational issue or conflict within a kink/BDSM context. The analysis must evaluate the structural integrity of the dynamic (Consent, Negotiation, Aftercare) and map the conflict back to core **attachment needs** and **somatic regulation** within the context of power exchange.

---

### üíª Workflow

1.  **Identify Context (Action):** Determine the core issue (is it a failure of **negotiation**, **aftercare**, or a **relational conflict** outside of scene?).
2.  **Consent & Safety Audit (Action 3):** Check the transcript/context against **[[Consent Culture]]** principles: Was consent explicit, enthusiastic, and ongoing? Were safewords or limits ignored/missed? (Check **RACK/SSC** fidelity).
3.  **Negotiation & Structure:** Evaluate the clarity of the pre-scene/pre-agreement negotiation. Were expectations, boundaries, and veto rights clearly articulated?
4.  **Aftercare Assessment (Action 3):** Analyze the post-scene communication. Was **somatic/emotional aftercare** adequate? Map any post-scene conflict to a **[[Polyvagal Theory]]** state (e.g., failure to up-regulate from Dorsal Vagal shutdown).
5.  **Power Dynamics & Attachment (Action 3):** Identify how the power differential in the dynamic (D/s) is impacting the partners' **[[Attachment Theory]]** needs outside of the scene (e.g., the submissive partner fears rejection when setting a non-kink boundary).
6.  **Synthesis and Feedback:** Provide specific, actionable feedback for improving **Negotiation** and **Aftercare** practices.

## üìö Frameworks Referenced

The analysis relies on the following frameworks, sorted by primary relevance:

1.  **[[Consent Culture]]** (Primary Relevance): Essential for evaluating the ethical and structural foundation of the dynamic, including concepts like **Enthusiastic Ongoing Consent (EOC)** and **RACK (Risk-Aware Consensual Kink)**.
2.  **[[Attachment Theory]]**: Critical for understanding how submission and dominance roles interface with core fears of abandonment (Anxious) or engulfment (Avoidant).
3.  **[[Polyvagal Theory]]**: Used to analyze the **somatic** experience of submission/dominance and post-scene emotional flooding, dissociation, or shutdown.
4.  **[[Internal Family Systems]]**: Useful for understanding the parts that assume submissive or dominant roles, and the exiled parts those roles protect.

- _Additional Helpful Framework:_ **SSC/RACK (Safe, Sane, Consensual / Risk-Aware Consensual Kink)**: Used as the primary safety and ethical guideline for the dynamic being analyzed.

## üìà Use Cases (Action 4)

| Use Case               | When to Apply                                                                                                 | Evidence-Based Suggestion                                                                                          |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Aftercare Failure**  | When emotional turmoil or conflict follows a scene or interaction.                                            | Focus on somatic needs and PVT state to ensure the issue is not a failure to co-regulate.                          |
| **Boundary Violation** | When a partner feels uneasy, unsafe, or reports a boundary was pushed.                                        | Apply the **[[Consent Culture]]** audit to determine if the agreement was clear and if the partner had veto power. |
| **Power Spillover**    | When the negotiated D/s dynamic affects non-kink aspects of the relationship (e.g., decision-making, chores). | Use this prompt to analyze the boundary between the _scene_ and _relational life_.                                 |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Concerns (Action 6)

- **Ethical Concern:** Kink analysis risks pathologizing non-normative behavior, misinterpreting submission as psychological damage, or equating dominance with abuse.
- **Constraint:** The analysis **MUST** assume the dynamic is fundamentally **consensual and therapeutic** (i.e., a place to safely explore needs) unless clear evidence of coercion or non-consent is present. The language used must be **affirmative and non-judgmental**.
