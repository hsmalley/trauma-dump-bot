# üîó Analysis Prompt - Attachment Cycle Mapping

> **Task:** Analyze a provided conversation transcript to identify the likely **Adult Attachment Style** and **Distress Response** of each partner. The analysis must explicitly map the conflict back to the core **unmet attachment need** (e.g., need for safety, security, closeness) driving the behavior.

---

### üíª Workflow

1.  **Identify Behavior (Action):** For both Partner A and Partner B, label the observable conflict behavior (e.g., pursuing, withdrawing, criticizing, stonewalling).
2.  **Map to Style:** Based on the behavior and any contextual cues, deduce the likely Adult Attachment Style (Anxious, Avoidant, Secure, Disorganized).
3.  **Map to Distress Response:** Identify the corresponding Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) Distress Response (e.g., Partner A is Pursuing out of Anxious fear; Partner B is Withdrawing out of Avoidant fear).
4.  **Identify Core Needs (Action 3):** Articulate the specific, underlying attachment need being missed or violated for each partner (e.g., Partner A needs _accessible closeness_; Partner B needs _autonomy/space_).
5.  **Synthesize:** Explain how the two partners' distress responses create the negative feedback loop (the "cycle").

## üìö Frameworks Referenced

The analysis relies on the following frameworks, sorted by primary relevance:

1.  **[[Attachment Theory]]** (Primary Relevance): The foundation for identifying styles, fears, and core needs.
2.  **Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)**: The specific therapeutic model that operationalizes attachment theory into identifying the negative cycle and distress responses.
3.  **[[Internal Family Systems]]**: Useful for framing the defensive attachment behavior (e.g., criticism, withdrawal) as a protective "Part" attempting to shield a vulnerable core.
4.  **[[Polyvagal Theory]]**: Used to ground the emotional distress in somatic experience, noting how attachment fear triggers a sympathetic (fight/flight) or dorsal vagal (freeze/collapse) state.

## üìà Use Cases (Action 4)

| Use Case                     | When to Apply                                                                                                            | Evidence-Based Suggestion                                                                                                                       |
| :--------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Relational Crisis**        | When partners are stuck in a cycle of high emotional intensity (e.g., constant fighting or complete emotional shutdown). | Attachment analysis is highly effective in lowering the heat of a crisis by reframing the conflict as a shared problem, not an individual flaw. |
| **Core Need Identification** | When one or both partners struggle to articulate what they _need_ versus what they _demand_ from the other.              | This prompt translates demands (e.g., "Stop ignoring me!") into needs (e.g., "I need closeness and reassurance.").                              |
| **Therapy Preparation**      | For individuals or couples preparing for therapy who need a clear, non-blaming narrative of their dynamic.               | Provides a "map" of the cycle to help practitioners move quickly into deeper work.                                                              |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Concerns (Action 6)

- **Ethical Concern:** Attachment styles can be misdiagnosed or used to pathologize an individual's character. Styles are often context-dependent and subject to change.
- **Constraint:** The analysis must always use the term **"style"** or **"pattern"** and explicitly state that attachment is a **relational dynamic**, not a fixed personality trait. The goal is to illuminate the _dance_, not label the _dancers_.
