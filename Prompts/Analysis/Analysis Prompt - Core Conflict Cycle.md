# ðŸ”„ Analysis Prompt - Core Conflict Cycle

> **Task:** Conduct a foundational audit of the transcript to identify the specific, repetitive **Core Conflict Cycle** (e.g., Pursuer-Distancer, Attack-Defend). The analysis must define the trigger, the roles adopted by each partner, the unmet need driving the dynamic, and the predictable outcome of the loop.

---

### ðŸ’» Workflow

1.  **Cycle Identification (Action):** Name the specific pattern present (e.g., Pursue/Withdraw, Attack/Defend, Blame/Justify). Provide quotes that exemplify the initiation and escalation of this pattern.
2.  **Role Assignment:** Clearly assign the dominant role to each partner within the cycle (e.g., Partner A is the **Pursuer**, Partner B is the **Distancer**). Note the rigidity of these roles.
3.  **Gottman Horseman Audit:** Scan the transcript for the presence of the **Four Horsemen** (Criticism, Contempt, Defensiveness, Stonewalling). Note which Horseman is most destructive in this specific cycle.
4.  **Unmet Needs Diagnosis (Action 3):** Use the **[[Nonviolent Communication (NVC)]]** lens to hypothesize the core, **unmet need** driving each partner's behavior _within the cycle_:
    - _The Pursuer's Need:_ (e.g., Need for Connection, Need to be Heard).
    - _The Distancer's Need:_ (e.g., Need for Autonomy, Need for Safety/Calm).
5.  **Micro-Skill Failure:** Identify the key **Micro-Skill** (e.g., taking a Time-Out, accepting a repair bid) that, if successfully executed, would have broken the cycle immediately.
6.  **Synthesis and Action:** Synthesize the finding into a single sentence that describes the cycle's mechanism ("When Partner A criticizes, Partner B stonewalls, leading both to feel abandoned.") and provide a single **Action Statement** aimed at disrupting the cycle.

## ðŸ“š Frameworks Referenced

1.  **Gottman Method (Primary)**: Provides the concepts of the Four Horsemen, repair attempts, and basic cycle analysis.
2.  **[[Nonviolent Communication (NVC)]]**: Essential for translating destructive behavior into understandable, unmet human needs.
3.  **Emotionally Focused Therapy (Implicit/EFT)**: Provides the foundation for the **Pursuer-Distancer** dynamic and the focus on underlying **Attachment** needs.

| **Initial Conflict Mapping** | When the user is confused about why they have the "same fight" repeatedly.                            | Provides immediate clarity by labeling the pattern and showing the mechanism of the cycle.                                   |
| **Identifying Root Needs**   | When one partner feels they are arguing about money, but the real issue is **safety** or **respect**. | Translates the surface-level topic into the deeper, unmet needs driving the conflict.                                        |
| **Pre-Trauma Analysis**      | To screen a conflict before escalating to **[[Analysis Prompt - Systemic & Trauma Mapping]]**.        | If the cycle is a simple communication failure, this prompt provides the simple fix without needing to open the trauma lens. |
