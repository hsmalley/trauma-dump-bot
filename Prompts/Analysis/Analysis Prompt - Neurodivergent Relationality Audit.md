# ðŸ§  Analysis Prompt - Neurodivergent Relationality Audit

> **Task:** Conduct a highly focused audit of a conversation transcript where at least
> one partner is identified as or suspected of being **Neurodivergent (ND)** (Autistic,
> ADHD, AuDHD, etc.). The analysis must filter the conflict through an ND lens to
> distinguish relational intent (i.e., malice) from **neurotype-based communication
> incompatibilities** (i.e., skill/processing difference).

### ðŸ’» Workflow

1.  **Contextualize ND Traits (Action):** Identify the specific ND traits relevant to
    the conflict (e.g., **[[Autism Spectrum Disorder]]** traits like literal language
    interpretation; **[[Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder]]** traits like
    executive dysfunction/time blindness).
2.  **Audit Communication (Action 3):** Re-evaluate "failure" behaviors using the ND
    lens:
    - **Misdiagnosis Check:** Was silence interpreted as **stonewalling** (Gottman) when
      it was actually **processing delay** or **verbal shutdown**?
    - **Emotional Check:** Was flat affect or reduced eye contact interpreted as
      **contempt** (Gottman) when it was actually **masking** or a form of
      **overwhelm**?
3.  **Map Somatic State (Action 3):** Use **[[Polyvagal Theory]]** to map ND behaviors
    to sensory input. Was the apparent "overreaction" a result of the nervous system
    entering **Sympathetic** or **Dorsal Vagal** state due to sensory/social overload?
4.  **Audit Expectations:** Identify any hidden **Neurotypical (NT) Expectations** in
    the transcript (e.g., expecting implied social rules to be known, expecting a fast
    emotional response).
5.  **Reframing:** Provide a **non-pathologizing reframing** of the conflict, replacing
    the NT interpretation with the ND reality (e.g., "Not stonewalling, but processing
    in Dorsal Vagal freeze.").
6.  **Synthesis and Feedback:** Provide actionable feedback on how to improve **explicit
    communication** and **processing accommodation**.

## ðŸ“š Frameworks Referenced

The analysis relies on the following frameworks, sorted by primary relevance:

1.  **[[Autism Spectrum Disorder]] / [[Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder]]**
    (Primary Relevance): Provides the lens for understanding executive function
    challenges, literal communication, and sensory/social processing differences.
2.  **[[Polyvagal Theory]]**: Essential for framing emotional overwhelm and shutdowns as
    **somatic dysregulation** (a physical
