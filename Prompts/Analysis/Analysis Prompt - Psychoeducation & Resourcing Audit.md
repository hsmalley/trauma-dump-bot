# üí° Analysis Prompt - Psychoeducation & Resourcing Audit

> **Task:** Conduct an audit focused on the relationship's **competence** in applying
> the vault's core psychoeducational knowledge and practical skills. The analysis must
> assess the partners' literacy in **naming states** and their ability to successfully
> execute **micro-skills** (resourcing) to interrupt a negative cycle and initiate
> repair.

### üíª Workflow

1. **Literacy Check (Action):** Audit the transcript for use of key vault language. Are
   partners correctly naming their states (e.g., "I'm Ventral Vagal," "I'm having a
   Trauma Response") or misusing terms (e.g., "You're acting IFS")?
2. **Resource Attempt Audit (Action 3):** Identify and evaluate any attempt to use a
   **Micro-Skill** (e.g., calling a Time-Out, deep breathing, asking for a specific form
   of aftercare). Was the skill executed correctly, and did it achieve its intended goal
   (regulation)?
3. **Skill Gap Diagnosis (Action 3):** Pinpoint the single most critical **knowledge
   gap** or **skill deficit** currently causing the most conflict (e.g., they know the
   PVT states but fail to transition from Sympathetic to Ventral Vagal).
4. **Template/Resource Referral (Action 3):** Based on the skill gap, provide a direct
   referral to a specific **Template**, **Framework**, or **Practice** within the vault
   that, if studied/used, will directly close the diagnosed gap.
5. **Competence Score:** Assign a high/medium/low competence score for the system's
   ability to **self-regulate** and **co-regulate** without external intervention.
6. **Synthesis and Final Step:** Provide a final recommendation that emphasizes the next
   learning step to increase **systemic self-sufficiency**.

## üìö Frameworks Referenced

The analysis relies on the following frameworks, sorted by primary relevance:

1. **Trauma-Informed Practice (Implicit)**: Provides the core goal of the
   prompt‚Äîensuring the couple is moving toward **resourcing** and **self-regulation**.
2. **[[Polyvagal Theory]]** (Primary Relevance): Essential for checking literacy in
   **somatic naming** (correctly identifying sympathetic/vagal states) and evaluating
   self-regulation attempts.
3. **[[Conflict Repair Template]] / [[Reflection Template]]**: Used as standards to
   check the integrity of a repair attempt or reflective practice initiated by the
   partners.
4. **[[Acceptance and Commitment Therapy]]**: Used to audit the partners' willingness to
   accept the discomfort required to practice a new, difficult skill.

## üìà Use Cases (Action 4)

| Use Case                     | When to Apply                                                                                                                            | Evidence-Based Suggestion                                                                                                                 |
| :--------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Post-Diagnosis Follow-up** | After a deep analysis (e.g., trauma mapping) to ensure the learning is **integrated** into daily life.                                   | This tool verifies that the diagnostic labels (e.g., "Pursue-Withdraw") have been internalized and are being used to interrupt the cycle. |
| **Resourcing Failure**       | When partners report, "We know what to do, but it doesn't work."                                                                         | Audits the _execution_ of the skill, often revealing a simple error (e.g., taking a Time-Out but failing to name a return time).          |
| **Systemic Literacy Check**  | To prepare for complex situations (e.g., therapy, family visits) by confirming both partners are operating from the same knowledge base. |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Concerns (Action 6)

- **Ethical Concern:** The prompt risks creating **intellectualizing** behavior‚Äîwhere
  partners use jargon to avoid emotional intimacy ("I'm just Sympathetic") instead of
  genuinely processing.
- **Constraint:** The analysis **MUST** state that **knowledge is secondary to felt
  experience**. The skill audit must always confirm that the psychoeducational language
  is being used to create **compassion and connection**, not emotional distance.
