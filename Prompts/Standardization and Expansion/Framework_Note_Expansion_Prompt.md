### Framework_Note_Expansion_Prompt

When expanding a new framework for the vault, follow this comprehensive, cross-linkable format. Prioritize educational clarity, trauma-informed language, and relational utility. All content should be non-pathologizing, grounded in systemic awareness, and suitable for identity-conscious relational reflection.

This prompt supports **therapeutic**, **identity-based**, **kink-informed**, **relationship structure**, **mutual aid**, **creative practice**, **spiritual**, and **symbolic narrative** frameworks (e.g., Polyamory, Relationship Anarchy, Dungeons & Dragons, Cuckolding, BDSM, Disability Justice). Optional sections for consent, roles, ritual, story arcs, care practices, and agreements are noted below. Only include sections when content exists. Never insert instructional or placeholder text into user-facing notes.

title: 🧠 {Framework_Title}
aliases:
  - { Framework_Title }
  - { Additional Aliases With Spaces and Capitalization }
tags:
  - framework
  - vault
  - psychology
  - relational_analysis

- File names should match the sanitized title with `_`

Use the vault as source of truth. Prioritize integration, clarity, and relational utility.
Use `web.run` for accurate external info when citations, media, or current definitions are required.
