### Framework_Note_Expansion_Prompt (Updated)

When expanding a new framework for the vault, follow this comprehensive, cross-linkable format. Prioritize educational clarity, trauma-informed language, and relational utility. All content should be non-pathologizing, grounded in systemic awareness, and suitable for identity-conscious relational reflection.

This prompt supports **therapeutic**, **identity-based**, and **kink-informed** frameworks (e.g., BDSM, Cuckolding, Fetish). Optional sections for consent, roles, and ritual are noted below.

### 🧠 YAML Frontmatter (Obsidian academic-ready)

Include this structured metadata block at the top of every framework note:

```yaml
---
title: "🧠 {{Framework_Title}}"
aliases: ["{{Framework_Title}}", "{{Sanitized_Title}}"]
tags: [framework, vault, psychology, relational_analysis, { { Custom_Tags } }]
related: [{ { List_of_Sanitized_Related_Frameworks } }]
source: "Educational synthesis from validated public sources"
citation: "ChatGPT-assisted summary with links to academic and practitioner materials"
created: { { YYYY-MM-DD } }
modified: { { YYYY-MM-DD } }
---
```

Use only `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, and `_` in `aliases`, `tags`, and `related`. Dates should auto-fill with today’s date.

### 🛠️ Strategies, Prompts, and Practices

**Stylistic Notes:**

- Use consistent emoji-section headings across the vault
- Avoid duplicating content—summarize, don’t rehash
- Phrase all content with reader learning and system reflection in mind
- Center autonomy, agency, and systemic compassion
- Cross-link terms wherever possible to support intra-vault coherence

---

This updated prompt ensures every framework entry is rigorous, inclusive, inter-referential, and usable for both internal mapping and interpersonal insight—including kink and power-aware dynamics.
