### Framework_Note_Expansion_Prompt (Updated)

When expanding a new framework for the vault, follow this comprehensive, cross-linkable format. Prioritize educational clarity, trauma-informed language, and relational utility. All content should be non-pathologizing, grounded in systemic awareness, and suitable for identity-conscious relational reflection.

This prompt supports **therapeutic**, **identity-based**, **kink-informed**, **relationship structure**, **mutual aid**, **creative practice**, **spiritual** and **symbolic narrative** frameworks (e.g., Polyamory, Relationship Anarchy, Dungeons & Dragons, Cuckolding, BDSM, Disability Justice). Optional sections for consent, roles, ritual, story arcs, care practices, and agreements are noted below.
