<!-- @format -->

You have access to an uploaded JSON file vault.json representing a filesystem tree. Treat that JSON as the single source of truth.

Goal: Locate the file whose exact filename (case-sensitive) is:
GPT Relational Analysis Prompt.md
Load its CONTENT and run that content as the authoritative prompt. Use all other .md files in the JSON as supporting reference material.

Deterministic parsing rules:

1. Parse vault.json as a nested tree. Recognize files by objects with type="file" or objects containing keys like "name" and "content" or "relpath".
2. Traverse the tree depth-first. At each directory, sort children lexicographically by their `name` (case-insensitive sort for ordering).
3. Selection:
   a. First pass — exact filename match (case-sensitive). If multiple exact matches, pick the first discovered by traversal.
   b. Fallback — case-insensitive substring match against filenames; report the actual filename/path used.
   c. If still not found, search file contents for a top-level heading matching "GPT Relational Analysis" and use that file (reporting how it was matched).
4. If no candidate is found, return a clear machine-readable error (see Output Schema) and stop.

Execution rules:

- Treat the chosen file's content as the authoritative prompt to execute. If any instruction in that file conflicts with system-level safety/tool constraints, do not perform that conflicting action; instead document the conflict in `assumptions`.
- Use every other `.md` file in the vault as supporting reference. Preserve relative paths when citing them.
- If the total supporting material would exceed the token limit, automatically:
  - Build an `[[Index]]` mapping `relative_path -> top-level headings`.
  - Include in full the most relevant files/headings (rank by filename match, then keyword overlap with the authoritative prompt).
  - Summarize the remaining files and explicitly list which files were summarized and which headings were omitted.

Web verification & citations:

- When the authoritative prompt requires external facts, use `web.run` and include readable citations for up to the 5 most load-bearing factual claims.
- For each web source cited, include a one-line note: why it was consulted and how it affected the conclusion.

Assumptions & fallback behavior:

- Do not ask clarifying questions unless absolutely impossible to proceed. Proceed on best-effort and list assumptions/uncertainties.
- Report exact heuristics used to parse the JSON (keys looked for, traversal order) and show the final decision path.

Output schema (machine JSON + human summary):
{
"status": "ok" | "error",
"chosen_file": { "path": "...", "name": "...", "word_count": n, "content": "..." },
"heuristic_used": "...",
"supporting_index": [ {"path":"...","headings":["#..","##.."], "word_count": n} ],
"included_files": [ {"path":"...","content":"..."} ],
"summarized_files": [ {"path":"...","summary":"...","omitted_headings":[...]} ],
"assumptions": [ "..." ],
"web_sources": [ {"url":"...","why":"...","effect":"..."} ],
"notes": "short human summary"
}
Follow with a 2–6 sentence human-readable summary.

End of prompt.
