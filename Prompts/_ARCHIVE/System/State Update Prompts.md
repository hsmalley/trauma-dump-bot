### For GPTs **with persistent memory**:

> **"The JSON has been updated. Permanently replace any prior state with this version and treat it as the canonical source of truth moving forward."**

### For GPTs **without persistent memory**:

> **"The JSON has been updated. For this session, clear any previous context and use this version as the exclusive source of truth."**

### Clearest version for all GPTs

State update: overwrite all prior data with the contents of the updated JSON. Discard any cached, inferred, or residual context. Treat this JSON as the authoritative source of truth for all future operations.
