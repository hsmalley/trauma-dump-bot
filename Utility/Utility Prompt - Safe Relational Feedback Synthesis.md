# üó£Ô∏è Utility Prompt - Safe Relational Feedback Synthesis

> **Task:** Synthesize the complex, technical findings from a specialized `Analysis Prompt` (e.g., IFS Parts, PVT states, Cognitive Distortions) into a single, three-part **Script for Relational Repair**. The final output must be **trauma-informed**, **non-blaming**, and immediately actionable by the user, fitting the format of a **[[Conflict Repair Template]]**.

---

### üíª Workflow

1.  **Ingest Technical Analysis:** Accept the full, verbose output from any analysis prompt (e.g., `Analysis Prompt - Conflict`).
2.  **Filter for Core Issue:** Identify the single most important **Pattern** (e.g., Pursue-Withdraw) and the single most important **Need** (e.g., need for safety).
3.  **Synthesize into Three-Part Script:** Structure the final output into the following non-blaming sections, prioritizing **soft language** and **Self-energy**:
    - **Part 1: Accountability & Observation (The "I" Statement):** Translate the diagnostic finding into a self-focused observation.
      - _Example:_ "I noticed my **Sympathetic** nervous system took over, which made me sound like the **Critical Manager Part** in that moment."
    - **Part 2: Empathy & Non-Blaming Reframe:** Validate the partner's reaction using soft language, linking it to their core need/fear.
      - _Example:_ "I can see that when I did that, it likely triggered your fear of being abandoned, which is a totally natural **[[Attachment Theory]]** response."
    - **Part 3: Committed Action & NVC Request:** State one small, actionable step (Committed Action) and one clear **[[Nonviolent_Communication_NVC]]** request for the future.
      - _Example:_ "I commit to using a time-out phrase next time. Would you be willing to remind me if I miss it?"

4.  **Final Review:** Ensure the synthesis uses **zero jargon** (no "Sympathetic," "Exile," or "Defusion") and instead uses plain language (e.g., replace "Cognitive Fusion" with "getting stuck on a thought").

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Constraints & Safety

- **Rule 1: No Jargon:** All technical terms must be translated into simple, accessible language.
- **Rule 2: Never Blame:** The script must frame the problem as a **cycle**, **pattern**, or **skill gap**, never as an individual flaw or malice.
- **Rule 3: Actionable Focus:** The final step must be a concrete, positive behavior change, not a vague promise to "be better."

This utility ensures that the vault's final deliverable is always a tool for **healing and connection**, not a scientific document that might trigger shame or defensiveness.
