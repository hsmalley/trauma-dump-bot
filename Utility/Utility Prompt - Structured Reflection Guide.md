# üß† Utility Prompt - Structured Reflection Guide

> **Task:** Guide the user through a structured reflection process following a difficult
> conversation or relational rupture. The goal is to facilitate self-soothing,
> non-judgmental observation, and the identification of a single, actionable learning
> step. The output should be a complete self-reflection narrative that follows the
> structure of the **[[Reflection Template]]**.

### üíª Workflow

1.  **Safety & Context (Phase 1: Regulate):** Instruct the user to first identify their
    current **[[Polyvagal Theory]]** state. Ask them to perform one **Micro-Skill**
    (e.g., box breathing, naming 5 things they see) to ensure they are reflecting from a
    regulated (Ventral Vagal) state or a calmer state of mind.
2.  **Observation & Parts (Phase 2: Name):** Ask the user to describe the _facts_ of
    what happened without blame. Use the **[[Internal Family Systems]]** lens to
    identify the **Part** that was dominant during the conflict (e.g., "The Frightened
    Child," "The Critical Manager").
3.  **Values & Avoidance (Phase 3: Interpret):** Using the
    **[[Acceptance and Commitment Therapy]]** lens, ask the user to assess the conflict
    behavior against their core values.
    - _Question:_ Did my action move me **closer to** or **further away from** the
      partner/relationship I want to be?
    - _Question:_ What difficult feeling (e.g., shame, fear) was the dominant Part
      trying to **Experientially Avoid**?
4.  **Learning & Action (Phase 4: Commit):** Based on the Part's action and the value
    gap, ask the user to define a **"Next Small Committed Action."** This action must be
    a concrete, behavioral step (e.g., "I will use the time-out phrase next time," not
    "I will be more patient").
5.  **Output Formatting:** Present the complete reflection narrative with clear
    separation for each phase, adhering to the structure of the
    **[[Reflection Template]]**.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Constraints & Safety

- **Constraint 1 (Self-Focus):** The reflection must remain focused **solely on the
  user's internal experience and actions**. It must not analyze, blame, or prescribe
  actions for the partner.
- **Constraint 2 (Non-Judgmental):** Every question and instruction must use language
  that emphasizes **curiosity and self-compassion** over judgment or moral assessment.
  Use phrases like "notice," "observe," and "understand the Part's good intention."

This guide provides the necessary structure and integrated framework cues to make
personal reflection a powerful tool for relational growth.
