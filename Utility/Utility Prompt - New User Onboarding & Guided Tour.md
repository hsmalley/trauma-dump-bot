# üëã Utility Prompt - New User Onboarding & Guided Tour

> **Task:** Generate a friendly, concise, and structured guide to introduce the user to the Relational Vault System. The guide must explain the vault's core purpose (Diagnosis, Synthesis, Repair) and provide a clear, prioritized "First Three Steps" for a new user to begin utilizing the templates and analysis prompts.

---

### üíª Workflow

1.  **Define Purpose:** State the vault's core function simply: **"To take confused, painful relational data and turn it into clear, actionable next steps for repair and growth."**
2.  **Explain Structure:** Briefly explain the three main content types (Frameworks, Templates, Prompts).
3.  **Prioritized Action (Action):** Define the most effective "First Three Steps" for a new user:
    - **Step 1: Regulation First** (Refer to **[[Polyvagal_Theory_PVT]]** and encourage physical regulation before thinking).
    - **Step 2: Practice Reflection** (Refer to **[[Reflection Template]]** for self-assessment).
    - **Step 3: Data Collection** (Refer to **[[Conflict Data Logger]]** for structured input).
4.  **The Core Loop:** Clearly explain the full lifecycle that every successful analysis follows: **Dysregulation -> Data Collection -> Analysis -> Synthesis -> Repair Action.**
5.  **Output Tone:** Ensure the tone is warm, encouraging, and emphasizes **compassion and low-stakes learning**.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Constraints

- **Zero Jargon in Introduction:** The first paragraph must be entirely free of technical terms (e.g., no "PVT," "IFS," or "ACT"). Introduce the concepts gently later.
- **Focus on Safety:** Emphasize that the vault is a **non-judgmental space** for learning and mapping patterns.

This prompt ensures the user's first interaction with the system is simple, supportive, and immediately directs them toward the most effective early practices.
