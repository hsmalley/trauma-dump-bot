# üìö Utility Prompt - Glossary Generator

> **Task:** Compile a comprehensive list of all technical terms, frameworks, acronyms,
> and specialized concepts recurring across the **Frameworks/** and **Analysis
> Prompts/** directories. The goal is to generate a single, easily searchable reference
> file (`_GLOSSARY_OF_TERMS.md`) containing clear, concise, and non-judgmental
> **relational definitions** for each term.

---

## üíª Workflow

1.  **Term Identification (Action):** Scan all files in the vault (prioritizing
    `Frameworks/` and `Prompts/`) for technical terms and acronyms, including:
    - **Acronyms:** ACT, IFS, PVT, ENM, NVC, CBT.
    - **Core Concepts:** Protector Part, Exile, Ventral Vagal, Sympathetic, Dorsal
      Vagal, Experiential Avoidance, Cognitive Fusion, Committed Action, Double Empathy
      Problem.
2.  **Relational Definition Synthesis (Action 3):** For each term, synthesize a
    definition that meets the following criteria:
    - **Concise:** Max one to two sentences.
    - **Relational:** Focus the definition on how the term impacts communication or
      dyadic interaction (e.g., define **Experiential Avoidance** as _a strategy to stop
      feeling painful emotions in the presence of your partner_).
    - **Non-Judgmental:** Adhere strictly to the **[[_CORE_PRINCIPLES_AND_GOVERNANCE]]**
      by ensuring definitions do not pathologize or assign blame.
3.  **Cross-Reference:** Ensure each definition provides a clear reference to the
    primary **[[Theory Reference Sheet]]** file where the concept is fully detailed.
4.  **Output Formatting:** Format the final output alphabetically, using clear Markdown
    headings for easy lookup.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Constraints & Safety

- **Constraint 1 (No Repetition):** Do not include terms already well-defined in the
  root templates (e.g., "Template," "Prompt," "Framework"). Stick to _psychological_ and
  _relational_ jargon.
- **Constraint 2 (Simplicity):** Prioritize simple language, even if the concept is
  complex. The glossary is for quick lookup, not deep instruction.

This final utility ensures that the system's knowledge is organized and accessible,
completing the last structural requirement for a clean, user-friendly vault.
