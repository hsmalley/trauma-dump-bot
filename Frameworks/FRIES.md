### üß© Definition and Core Themes

The **FRIES** framework is a universally accepted, explicit model used to define and teach the qualities of **Enthusiastic, Affirmative, and Ongoing Consent**. It is the gold standard for defining agreement, particularly in sexual contexts, and is a cornerstone of **Consent Culture**. This model emphasizes that consent is an **active process**, not a passive state.

- **Core Goal:** To shift the understanding of consent from the **absence of a "no"** to the **presence of a clear, affirmed, and conscious "yes."**
- **The FRIES Acronym:** Consent must meet all five criteria to be considered valid:

üçü FRIES: The Five Pillars of Consent

| Letter | Quality          | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :----: | :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **F**  | **Freely Given** | The decision to consent must be made without any **pressure, coercion, manipulation, or threat** of negative consequence. It cannot be given if a power imbalance exists that compromises choice. |
| **R**  | **Revocable**    | Consent is **not binding**. Anyone can change their mind and withdraw consent at **any time**, for any reason, even if they have consented before or during the act.                              |
| **I**  | **Informed**     | Consent is only valid when the person has **all the facts** about what they are consenting to. Hidden risks, activities, or partners invalidate the agreement.                                    |
| **E**  | **Enthusiastic** | Consent must be a **clear, eager "yes"**‚Äînot a hesitant, ambivalent, or reluctant response (a lack of enthusiasm means "no").                                                                     |
| **S**  | **Specific**     | Consent for one activity **does not imply** consent for others. Saying "yes" to kissing is not saying "yes" to intercourse; saying "yes" today is not saying "yes" tomorrow.                      |

### üåø Traits and Lived Experience

Operating under the FRIES model creates a lived experience of high **agency** and **psychological safety**, replacing guesswork and ambiguity with clear communication.

- **Empowerment:** The **Freely Given** and **Revocable** principles fundamentally empower the individual, teaching them that their autonomy and body belong to them and are subject to their will alone, regardless of their past decisions.
- **Clarity:** The **Informed** and **Specific** principles reduce the anxiety of ambiguity. The responsibility is always on the person initiating the action to seek and confirm a clear agreement for _this specific action, right now_.
- **Joy and Presence:** The **Enthusiastic** principle ensures that when a boundary is crossed, it is not simply tolerated but is an active desire, which enhances mutual pleasure and **presence** in the moment, as neither party is worried about misinterpreting cues.

### üß† Nervous System and Parts Work Lens

FRIES is a foundational tool for establishing relational and internal safety, directly facilitating **Ventral Vagal** regulation.

- **Safety and Self-Regulation (PVT):** The **Revocable** aspect is a powerful tool for **nervous system regulation**. Knowing that one has the ultimate veto power (the right to say "no" and be respected) signals to the brain that the environment is safe, activating the **Ventral Vagal (Safe and Social)** system and reducing the need for hyper-vigilance (Sympathetic activation).
- **Unburdening the Pleaser (IFS):** The model directly confronts and helps unburden **Manager Parts** like **The People-Pleaser**. By making consent **Enthusiastic**, the model gives the individual permission to prioritize their genuine desire over the fear of disappointing or angering the other person.
- **Integrity:** Adhering to FRIES builds **Self-energy** by aligning external behavior (actions taken) with internal truth (genuine desire), fostering a sense of internal cohesion and integrity.

### üíû Attachment and Relational Patterns

FRIES provides the clearest framework for building and maintaining **Secure Attachment** by establishing an unshakeable foundation of respect and reliability.

- **Reliable Responsiveness:** When a partner respects all five FRIES principles‚Äîespecially the **Revocable** clause‚Äîthey demonstrate **reliable responsiveness**. This is a powerful, non-verbal message to the partner's internal system that **"You are safe with me, and I will always prioritize your well-being,"** which is the definition of a secure bond.
- **Healing Insecurity:** For those with **Anxious Attachment**, the clear need to obtain **Enthusiastic** consent reassures them that they are desirable and not just being tolerated. For those with **Avoidant Attachment**, the **Specific** and **Informed** nature of FRIES allows them to maintain clear boundaries without being engulfed by ambiguity or expectation.
- **Boundary Fortification:** FRIES acts as the ultimate set of **Boundary Models** for relational interactions, ensuring that communication about desires and limits is always explicit, not assumed.

### üõ†Ô∏è Strategies, Prompts, and Practices

- **Micro-Skill (The Revocability Check-in):** In any ongoing activity, pause and ask questions that reinforce the **Revocable** and **Enthusiastic** principles: _"Are you still feeling good about this?"_ or _"Do you want me to keep going, or would you like to shift what we're doing?"_
- **Prompt (The Informed Check):** Before introducing a new activity, use the **Informed** and **Specific** principle to check for agreement: _"I'd like to try [new specific act]. I want you to know this involves [list of facts/risks]. How does that sound to you right now?"_
- **Micro-Skill (Receiving a "No"):** When consent is withdrawn or not given, the partner should explicitly validate the boundary using the **F** and **R** principles: _"Thank you for being clear with me. I completely respect your choice, and I'm happy to stop immediately."_ (This reinforces the safety and makes future consent easier to obtain).
