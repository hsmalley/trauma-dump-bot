## Overview  
Liberation Psychology emerged in Latin America in the 1970s–80s as a critical corrective to mainstream Western psychology. It was pioneered by Ignacio Martín‑Baró, who sought to foreground the sociopolitical contexts of oppression, power, and injustice in psychological theory and practice.  
Rather than treating distress as only intrapsychic, Liberation Psychology insists on situating individuals within systems of power, historical trauma, and structural inequality.

## Core Concepts  
### Critical Consciousness & Conscientización  
A process of raising awareness about how sociopolitical forces shape psychological suffering.  

### De‑Ideologized Reality  
Helps clients unveil how dominant ideologies conceal the structural roots of pain and oppression.  

### Social Orientation & Preferential Option for the Oppressed  
Prioritizes marginalized voices and collective liberation over individual pathologizing.  

### Methodological Eclecticism  
Incorporates qualitative, narrative, and participatory methods.

## Applications  
- Therapy that situates trauma in systemic oppression  
- Community mental health initiatives  
- Research methods that prioritize community voice  

## Best Practices & Considerations
