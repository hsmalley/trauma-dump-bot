# 🍟 FRIES: The Five Pillars of Consent

**FRIES** is an acronym that outlines the core qualities of **healthy, ethical consent**. It was popularized by Planned Parenthood and is widely used in consent education and trauma-informed practice. It serves as a **simple, memorable standard** for recognizing when consent is real, and when it's being compromised.

## 🔑 FRIES Breakdown

### **F — Freely Given**

- Consent must come without pressure, manipulation, threats, guilt, or coercion.
- A “yes” is only meaningful if “no” is truly safe.
- Fawn responses and power imbalances may distort a “freely given” yes.

### **R — Reversible**

- Consent can be changed or withdrawn at any time—even mid-scene or mid-activity.
- A past yes doesn’t guarantee a future yes.
- Healthy relationships support and honor boundary shifts without punishment.

### **I — Informed**

- Consent is only valid if all parties know what they’re agreeing to.
- Includes understanding risks, context, and any relevant information.
- “Informed” also means being clear on emotional, physical, and relational expectations.

### **E — Enthusiastic**

- Consent should be given with excitement, interest, and clarity—not obligation or fear.
- “I guess so” or “if you really want to” are not enthusiastic.
- In trauma-aware settings, enthusiasm may look like calm readiness, not overt eagerness.

### **S — Specific**

- Consent is for _this thing, at this time, in this way_.
- Saying yes to one activity doesn’t mean yes to all activities.
- Specificity supports layered consent and reduces assumption-based harm.

## 🛠 Practices Aligned with FRIES

- Use explicit scripts: “I’m a yes to **_, but a no to _**.”
- Check in during play: “Still good?” “Want to keep going?”
- Clarify contexts: “What does this mean to you?” “What are you expecting?”
- Reaffirm consent in altered states (e.g., subspace, high arousal) with built-in pauses.

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- Where in my life does “no” not feel like a real option?
- How do I signal authentic enthusiasm—verbally and nonverbally?
- Where have I felt pressure to say yes, even subtly?
- How do I respond when someone changes their mind?
