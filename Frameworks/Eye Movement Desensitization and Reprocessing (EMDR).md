# 👁️ Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)

**EMDR** is an integrative, phased therapy developed by Francine Shapiro that helps individuals **process and resolve traumatic memories** by combining focused recall with **bilateral stimulation** (typically eye movements, tapping, or auditory tones).

It’s based on the idea that traumatic or disturbing experiences can become “stuck” in the nervous system, leading to distress and maladaptive beliefs. EMDR facilitates **adaptive reprocessing**, allowing the brain to integrate the experience without overwhelm.

## 🧠 Core Principles

### 1. **Memory Reprocessing, Not Erasure**

- Traumatic memories are _re-linked_ to adaptive information—not deleted.
- Clients often shift from "I'm not safe" → "I survived" or "I have choices now."

### 2. **Bilateral Stimulation**

- Alternating visual, tactile, or auditory cues activate both brain hemispheres.
- Supports integration across cognitive, emotional, and somatic levels.

### 3. **Adaptive Information Processing (AIP) Model**

- The brain has a natural healing system that can be disrupted by trauma.
- EMDR reactivates this system to complete unfinished processing.

## 🔄 The 8 Phases of EMDR

1. **History Taking & Treatment Planning**
2. **Preparation** – Resourcing, stabilization, consent.
3. **Assessment** – Identify target memory, negative/positive beliefs, and distress scale.
4. **Desensitization** – Bilateral stimulation while holding memory in mind.
5. **Installation** – Strengthen adaptive beliefs (e.g., “I am safe now.”)
6. **Body Scan** – Track residual somatic tension and clear it.
7. **Closure** – Regulate, reorient, ground.
8. **Re-evaluation** – Check for unresolved material.

## 🧠 Nervous System Integration

- Supports trauma resolution without re-traumatization.
- Can reduce **hypervigilance, shutdown, or flashbacks** by completing threat responses.
- Often includes **somatic tracking**, especially in body-stored trauma.

## 🛠 Relational Applications (with caution)

- EMDR is not a relational tool per se—but insights gained from EMDR can:
  - Shift attachment styles (e.g., reduce anxious looping or avoidant withdrawal).
  - Challenge internalized beliefs (“I’m too much” → “I am worthy of care”).
  - Improve capacity for presence, repair, and emotional risk.

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- What memory or belief still feels “charged” in my body?
- What do I _know_ now that my body doesn’t fully believe?
- What supportive resources help me stay grounded when remembering hard things?

- [[Trauma-Informed Care (TIC)]]
- [[Polyvagal Theory]] — window of tolerance guides pacing and resourcing.
- [[Narrative Therapy]] — reframing trauma stories post-processing.

## ⚠️ Scope & Safety

- EMDR should be practiced with a **licensed and trained provider**.
- Not suitable for self-practice in early trauma recovery or high dissociation without support.
