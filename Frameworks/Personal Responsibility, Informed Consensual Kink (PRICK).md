# 🧷 Personal Responsibility, Informed Consensual Kink (PRICK)

**PRICK** stands for **Personal Responsibility, Informed, Consensual Kink**. It is an ethical framework in BDSM and kink communities that emphasizes **radical accountability, autonomy, and informed consent**. It builds on and critiques older models like [[Safe, Sane, and Consensual (SSC)]] and [[Risk-Aware Consensual Kink (RACK)]].

PRICK centers the idea that **participants are responsible for their own boundaries, safety preparation, and continued consent**, while recognizing the importance of mutual care and transparency.

## 🔑 Core Principles

### 1. **Personal Responsibility**

- Each participant owns their preparation, boundaries, and decision-making.
- Encourages self-knowledge: triggers, risks, needs, and capacity.
- Shifts focus from safety policing to relational accountability.

### 2. **Informed**

- All parties are given access to relevant information (e.g., experience level, physical/mental health, risks).
- Informed also means understanding **how** the play may affect you emotionally or physiologically.

### 3. **Consensual**

- Consent must be **active, ongoing, specific, and revocable**.
- Valid consent includes the ability to withdraw _without retaliation_.
- Consent is not just a yes—it’s an _informed and empowered yes_.

### 4. **Kink**

- Embraces the wide spectrum of consensual power exchange, sensation, and identity play.
- Welcomes edge play, taboo dynamics, and altered states _if consented to and responsibly held_.

## 🧠 Nervous System Awareness

- Supports trauma-informed practices: _“Is this a yes from my body, not just my words?”_
- Acknowledges altered states (e.g., subspace) and plans for grounding, regulation, and post-scene care.
- Encourages **interoceptive literacy**: recognizing and communicating what your body is telling you before, during, and after play.

## 🛠 PRICK Practices

- **Pre-scene negotiation with shared disclosures** (e.g., trauma history, triggers).
- **Mutual post-scene processing**—not just aftercare, but accountability check-ins.
- **Boundary literacy**: Knowing your “yes,” “no,” and “maybe,” and how to communicate them.
- **Continual self-inquiry**: “Am I choosing this freely, from a place of knowing and integrity?”
