# 🌍 Liberation & Intersectional Feminist Psychology

**Liberation and Intersectional Feminist Psychology** are aligned frameworks that center healing as a **contextual, political, and relational act**. They reject pathologizing models that isolate suffering from its systemic roots, instead affirming that **identity, power, and culture shape psychological experience**.

These frameworks draw from **Kimberlé Crenshaw’s intersectionality**, **Paulo Freire’s critical pedagogy**, and **community-rooted mental health** approaches.

## 🧠 Core Principles

### 🔹 The Personal is Political

- Internal distress often mirrors external oppression.
- Shame, anxiety, or numbness may be logical responses to chronic invalidation, racism, or marginalization.

### 🔹 Systems Shape Symptoms

- “What’s wrong with you?” becomes “What happened to you—and what systems made that harder?”
- Trauma is often _systemic, collective, and ongoing_.

### 🔹 Identity-Aware & Power-Conscious

- Healing requires naming **who has power, how it’s maintained**, and **whose voices are missing**.
- Lived experience, cultural wisdom, and ancestral knowledge are centered.

### 🔹 Consent, Agency, and Resistance

- Affirms autonomy and choice—not compliance or “fixing.”
- Survival strategies (e.g., dissociation, anger, masking) are **resistance**, not flaws.

## 🔍 Relational & Therapeutic Applications

- Deconstruct roles shaped by oppression (e.g., fawn, overfunction, emotional labor).
- Validate identity-based pain, boundary ruptures, and code-switching as **contextual adaptations**.
- Use **power-mapping** to explore how dominance and erasure operate in relational dynamics.

---

## 🧠 Nervous System & Trauma Lens

- Body-based trauma must be **understood through systemic history** (e.g., racialized trauma, colonization, ableism).
- Healing includes reclaiming safety in voice, body, and relationship—not just symptom relief.

## 🛠 Practices & Prompts

- “What systems made this harder?”
- “What part of you learned to survive this way—and what did it protect?”
- “Who benefits from this story of you being broken?”
- “What does justice look like inside your body?”

---

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- Where has my suffering been silenced, blamed, or misnamed?
- What does reclaiming power look like in my relationships?
- How do my identities shape access to safety, care, or voice?
- What would it feel like to relate to myself _without_ domination?

## 🔄 Integration with Other Frameworks

- [[Internal Family Systems (IFS)]] — contextualizing parts in identity and power.
- [[Consent Culture]] — informed by liberation, not just preference.
- [[Containment Models]] — adapted for collective and cultural holding.
- [[Boundaries and Power Models]] — rooted in justice, not control.
