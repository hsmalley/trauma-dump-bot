# Intersectional Feminist Psychology

## Overview
Applies intersectionality (Crenshaw) to psychology, examining how overlapping identities and systems of power shape experience.

## Core Principles
- Multiple identities intersect to amplify or buffer risk  
- Power dynamics and bias operate at micro/macro levels  
- Safety and consent are identity-contextual  

## Application
- Assess safety and inclusion for all identities involved  
- Use bias checks and perspectival humility  
- Tailor consent and repair to power differentials
