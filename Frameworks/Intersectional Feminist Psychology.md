# ♀️ Intersectional Feminist Psychology

**Intersectional Feminist Psychology** is a framework that centers the impact of **power, oppression, identity, and systems** on psychological development and relational life. Rooted in both feminism and liberation psychology, it challenges pathologizing models by naming how **race, gender, class, disability, sexuality, and other identities intersect** to shape experience, access, and safety.

Coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw, _intersectionality_ emphasizes that people experience systemic oppression in **complex, overlapping ways**—not as isolated identities.

## 🧠 Core Principles

### 1. **The Personal is Political**

- Individual distress often mirrors systemic harm (e.g., gaslighting, burnout, isolation).
- Healing includes **naming context**—not just internal “issues.”

### 2. **Power-Consciousness**

- Recognizes dynamics of privilege, dominance, and marginalization.
- Looks at _who has power, who doesn't, and how it’s upheld or disrupted_.

### 3. **Centering the Margins**

- Lifts the voices, experiences, and wisdom of those most impacted.
- Validates survival strategies that dominant culture may pathologize.

### 4. **Agency, Not Compliance**

- Moves from control to consent, from obedience to autonomy.
- Resists “fixing” people to fit systems—focuses on capacity-building and justice.

## 🔍 Practices in Relational Analysis

- **Contextualizing behavior**: “How does this response make sense in light of lived experience?”
- **Power-mapping**: Who is at risk, and why? Who defines safety or normalcy?
- **De-pathologizing**: Reframe traits (e.g., “too sensitive,” “too angry”) as contextually valid responses.

## 🧠 Trauma Lens

- Trauma is often systemic, not just individual (e.g., colonialism, racism, ableism).
- Intersectional models validate **collective grief**, **ancestral wounds**, and **identity-based trauma**.
- Consent and boundaries must account for **power asymmetries** (e.g., therapist-client, partner dynamics, group norms).

## 🛠 Skills and Prompts

- Ask: “What systems shape how this person is seen, heard, treated?”
- Practice **relational humility**: “Whose knowledge is missing here?”
- Validate lived experience over imposed norms.
- Invite **cultural self-awareness**: What dominant narratives am I unconsciously holding?

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- What identities do I carry—and which ones get erased, privileged, or punished?
- How does my pain relate to larger systems, not just personal failures?
- What stories of worth, voice, or permission have I inherited—and do I want to keep them?
- Who benefits from me staying small, silent, or self-blaming?
