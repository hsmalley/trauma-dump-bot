### üß© Definition and Core Themes

**RADAR** is an acronym used across multiple disciplines (psychology, crisis management, relationship coaching) to denote a structured, five-step process for either **managing conflict** or **improving communication**. The specific meaning of the letters changes based on the context, but the core function is always to shift from reactive to **reflective** behavior.

### üíñ 1. RADAR for Relational Check-ins (Multiamory Model)

This is a structured, regular process used by partners to intentionally process grievances, plan logistics, and ensure the emotional health of the relationship. It is often used in **Ethical Non-Monogamy (ENM)** but is applicable to all relationships.

| Step | Principle | Purpose in Communication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R** | **Review** | Briefly recap the time since the last check-in. Stick to facts and review past agreed-upon **Action Points**. |
| **A** | **Agree the Agenda** | Collaboratively set the specific topics for discussion. This ensures both partners' concerns are prioritized and the focus remains contained. |
| **D** | **Discuss** | Engage in active, empathetic dialogue to process the agenda items. Requires focusing on feelings and needs, often using **Nonviolent Communication (NVC)** principles. |
| **A** | **Action Points** | Decide on tangible, specific, and time-bound steps to address challenges or implement agreed-upon changes. |
| **R** | **Re-connect** | End the session on a positive, affectionate note to reinforce the **emotional security** of the relationship and counter the negative tone of the discussion phase. |

### üõ°Ô∏è 2. RADAR for Situational Awareness and Crisis (Mandt System)

This model is a safety and de-escalation tool used to guide a person's behavior in potentially risky, threatening, or emotionally escalating situations.

| Step | Principle | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R** | **Recognize** | Be aware of your surroundings and the cues of escalating conflict (**neuroception**). Recognize your own emotional state and the subtle shifts in the other person's behavior. |
| **A** | **Assess** | Evaluate the information gathered. What is the threat level? What is the other person's intent? Where are the available exits? |
| **D** | **Decide** | Choose the safest, most effective course of action (e.g., de-escalation, disengagement, seeking help). |
| **A** | **Act** | Execute the decided plan calmly and firmly. |
| **R** | **Review Results** | Reflect on the outcome of the action to learn from it and ensure the threat is fully contained, or if further action is needed. |
