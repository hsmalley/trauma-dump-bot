# 🧲 Containment Models

**Containment** refers to the internal and relational capacity to **hold emotions, experiences, and boundaries** in ways that foster safety, integration, and attunement. In trauma-informed care, containment models help distinguish between **what we can hold, what we should release, and what we need help regulating**.

Containment is not about suppression or control—it’s about _supporting coherence without overwhelm_.

## 🧱 Types of Containment

### **Internal Containment**

- Self-regulation and emotional resilience.
- Involves nervous system awareness, part-to-part attunement (IFS), and self-boundaried presence.

### **Relational Containment**

- Co-regulation through attuned, grounded presence of another.
- Holding space without fixing, rescuing, or collapsing.

### **Systemic Containment**

- Organizational, cultural, or structural supports that create predictability and safety (e.g., agreements, norms, policies).

## 🧠 Trauma & Nervous System Relevance

- Trauma often disrupts containment: flooding, shutdown, or externalization.
- **Fawn and overfunctioning** can mimic relational containment but actually signal collapse or dysregulation.
- Containment restores agency by offering **predictability, boundaries, and felt safety**.

## 🛠 Containment Practices

- **Body Check-Ins**: “What’s my capacity right now?”
- **Containment Mapping**:
  - _What’s mine to hold?_
  - _What’s not mine?_
  - _What do I need help holding?_
- **Window of Tolerance Anchoring**: Identifying cues of too much / too little activation.
- **Container Scripts**:
  - “I hear that this is big. Can we pause so I can show up fully?”
  - “I want to stay with you, but I need a boundary to hold both of us safely.”

## 🔄 Integration with Other Frameworks

- **IFS**: Helps parts build inner containers and renegotiate trauma burdens.
- **Polyvagal Theory**: Anchors containment in ventral vagal states (regulation, connection).
- **Consent Culture**: Encourages emotional honesty and capacity-based engagement.
- **Empowerment Triangle**: Supports boundaries without slipping into rescuer/victim modes.

- When do I overcontain for others at the cost of myself?
- What helps me ground and recontain when overwhelmed?
