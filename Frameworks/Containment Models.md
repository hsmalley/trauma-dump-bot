# Containment Models

## Overview

Practices and structures that hold emotional intensity safely (timers, protocols, containers) to stay within the Window of Tolerance.

## Core Principles

- Structure increases safety and reduces reactivity
- Time-bounding and pacing prevent overwhelm
- Containers require shared setup and debrief

## Application

- Use topic containers, timeboxes, and 'parking lots'
- Agree on escalation protocols and pause words
- Close with recap, appreciation, and next steps
