# 💗 Polyamory

**Polyamory** refers to the **practice or philosophy of engaging in multiple consensual, loving, and emotionally intimate relationships** at the same time—with the knowledge and agreement of everyone involved.

It differs from other forms of non-monogamy in its emphasis on **emotional connection, authenticity, and ongoing care**, not just openness to sex with multiple partners.

## 🧠 Core Values

### 1. **Consent & Transparency**

- Everyone involved understands and consents to the structure.
- Honesty ≠ radical disclosure; it means _truth with care_.

### 2. **Relational Autonomy**

- Partners are not possessions.
- Autonomy coexists with consideration, co-regulation, and interdependence.

### 3. **Emotional Literacy**

- Regular check-ins, emotional processing, and clear expression of needs are key.

### 4. **Relational Design**

- Rejects "default" models in favor of consciously co-created agreements.
- Encourages diversity of roles (e.g., nesting, co-parenting, comet, parallel, kitchen-table).

- **Time & Energy Scarcity**: Requires calendar skills and honest capacity tracking.
- **Attachment Activation**: Can trigger anxious or avoidant tendencies.
- **Cultural Marginalization**: Polyamory often lacks social script, support, or legal recognition.
