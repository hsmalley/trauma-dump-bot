### üß© Definition and Core Themes

**Transformative Justice (TJ)** is a political and philosophical approach to crime, harm, and conflict that seeks to address and resolve incidents of violence **without resorting to the police, prisons, or state-based punitive systems**. It is an abolitionist framework that looks beyond individual conflict to address the **root causes of violence** (such as racism, sexism, poverty, and ableism) and transform the conditions that allowed the harm to occur.

- **Core Goal:** To create **community-based accountability and safety mechanisms** that stop violence in the present, heal those who were harmed, and ensure the fundamental conditions of the community are changed so the violence is less likely to happen again.
- **TJ vs. RJ:** While **Restorative Justice (RJ)** focuses on repairing the harm between the victim and offender, TJ goes further by demanding the **transformation of the entire social system** that produced the harm. TJ is often used for severe, systemic violence (e.g., sexual assault, domestic violence) where a meeting between the harmed and the person who caused harm is inappropriate or unsafe.
- **Abolitionist Framework:** TJ is a core tool of the prison abolition movement, positing that community-led processes can be more effective, healing, and accountable than the state criminal justice system.

### üåø Key Principles and Practices

TJ shifts focus and responsibility away from the state and onto the affected community.

1.  **Safety and Support for the Harmed:** The process begins and centers on the **needs and self-determination** of the person who was harmed. Their physical and emotional safety is the non-negotiable priority.
2.  **Community Accountability:** The responsibility for addressing and preventing harm belongs to the **community** surrounding the person who caused harm, not just the individual themselves. The community's task is to interrupt the behavior, support the person who was harmed, and hold the person who caused harm accountable.
3.  **No Banishment:** The goal is to avoid exile or abandonment of the person who caused harm. Instead, the community works to interrupt the harmful behavior, facilitate deep learning and change, and ultimately **integrate** the person back into the social fabric in a non-harmful way.
4.  **Addressing Root Causes:** The work explicitly analyzes the **systemic context** of the harm (e.g., "How did internalized sexism enable this assault? How did economic precarity contribute to this theft?").

### üß† Psychological and Relational Impact

TJ is designed to foster a sense of collective efficacy and healing from systemic trauma.

- **Systemic Healing:** By moving the focus from "bad individuals" to **"bad systems,"** TJ reduces the individual shame and isolation often associated with being harmed or causing harm, placing the burden on the collective.
- **Power Redistribution:** The process is inherently non-hierarchical, empowering the person who was harmed and the community members to define justice and accountability, countering the inherent **Power Dynamics** of state-based systems.
- **Agency and Self-Determination:** For the person who was harmed, TJ offers an alternative to the traumatizing, re-victimizing experience of the criminal justice system, restoring **agency** by allowing them to define what repair and safety look like.

### üõ†Ô∏è Strategies and Practices

TJ is implemented via collaborative processes that are highly customized to the specific incident.

- **Accountability Teams (ATs):** Small, dedicated groups from the person who caused harm's community who take on the task of holding them accountable, providing emotional support, and monitoring their adherence to a collectively defined **Action Plan**.
- **Action Plans:** Concrete steps defined by the community and the person who caused harm that focus on behavior change, emotional growth, and making amends (e.g., therapy, cessation of substance use, political education, restitution).
- **Community Pods:** Similar to Accountability Teams, these are support structures that focus entirely on providing safety and sustained emotional, financial, and logistical support to the person who was harmed.
