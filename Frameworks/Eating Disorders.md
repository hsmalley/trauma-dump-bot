# Eating Disorders — Framework Notes

> Practical, trauma-informed guide for rapid assessment, medical and psychosocial
> triage, brief interventions, and care coordination for people with suspected or
> confirmed eating disorders.

---

## Purpose

- Supply a concise, evidence-aligned template for clinicians and care teams to assess
  medical and psychiatric risk, create immediate stabilization and safety plans, and
  arrange timely follow-up or escalation.
- Support consistent documentation and handoffs across settings (ED, primary care,
  outpatient mental health, school health).
- Grounded in published guidance and common screening/treatment approaches.
  [oai_citation:0‡NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng69?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

## Scope & Audience

- Intended for initial and ongoing use with adolescents and adults presenting with
  restrictive, binge/purge, or avoidant/restrictive behaviors, disordered eating
  thoughts, or medically concerning weight loss.
- Not exhaustive—specialist input (medical and eating-disorder–trained mental-health
  clinicians and dietitians) recommended for moderate-to-high risk or complex
  presentations.

## Quick Immediate Safety Checklist (first 5–10 minutes)

1. **Immediate danger?** Ask direct questions about suicidal ideation, self-harm, or
   intent. If positive or if acute medical collapse, activate emergency pathways.
   (Eating disorders carry elevated suicide risk—treat disclosures seriously).
   [oai_citation:2‡National Eating Disorders Association](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/statistics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
2. **Medical instability screen** (see below for details): severe bradycardia,
   hypotension, syncope/orthostatic changes, electrolyte abnormalities (esp.
   hypokalemia), acute food refusal, rapid weight loss, signs of organ compromise—treat
   as medical emergency.
   [oai_citation:3‡NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng69?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
3. **Contain immediate risk:** ensure safe environment (remove easily accessible means
   if imminent self-harm risk), arrange urgent medical observation or admission if
   unstable, obtain IV access and basic labs if indicated.
4. **Triage level:** decide whether ED admission, medical stabilization unit,
   psychiatric inpatient, or outpatient pathway is appropriate (use risk stratification
   below).
5. **Document verbatim statements** about weight, shape, food behaviors, and any
   suicidal/self-harm ideation; obtain consent for necessary information-sharing with
   guardians/providers per local law.

---

## Structured Risk / Conceptual Assessment (core domains)

- **Presenting concern & history:** onset, duration, and evolution of restriction,
  binging, purging, compensatory behaviors, and functional impairment.
- **Medical status:** recent weight / % weight loss, trend, BMI (contextualize for
  age/sex/height), vitals (HR, BP, orthostatic vitals), temperature, ECG if bradycardic
  or on QT-prolonging meds, electrolyte panel (K, Na, phosphate, Mg), renal/hepatic
  markers.
  [oai_citation:4‡NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng69?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Nutritional intake and behaviors:** current intake, food avoidance, ARFID features,
  laxative/diuretic/insulin misuse, vomiting frequency.
- **Psychiatric risk:** suicidal ideation/intent, self-harm behaviors, comorbid
  mood/anxiety/substance use, psychosis, severe agitation.
  [oai_citation:5‡National Institute of Mental Health](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/eating-disorders?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Functional status & cognition:** concentration, capacity to make treatment
  decisions, dissociation, severe cognitive impairment from malnutrition.
- **Social context & supports:** family/carer involvement, living situation, access to
  care, cultural & gender considerations, access to weight-loss medications or pro-ED
  online communities.
  [oai_citation:6‡WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/eating-disorder-content-is-infiltrating-tiktok-some-creators-are-going-viral-debunking-it?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Screening tools (use per local protocol):** SCOFF for quick case-finding; EDE-Q,
  EDI, or structured clinical interview when available. Validate positive screens with
  clinical interview.
  [oai_citation:7‡PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1070794/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

## Risk Stratification (practical triage)

- **Low risk (outpatient monitoring):** stable vitals, stable weight or slow gradual
  loss, no acute electrolyte disturbance, no suicidality/acute medical issues, reliable
  supports and rapid access to outpatient specialty care. Safety plan and close
  follow-up within 48–72 hours recommended.
  [oai_citation:8‡NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng69?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Moderate risk (urgent outpatient / consider short admission):** notable weight loss,
  intermittent purging or laxative misuse, mild electrolyte abnormalities, limited
  supports, or comorbid mood disorder with passive suicidal ideation—consider brief
  medical admission or intensive outpatient with daily monitoring and dietitian
  involvement.
  [oai_citation:9‡NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng69?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **High / Immediate risk (admit & stabilize):** clear medical instability (marked
  bradycardia, hypotension, syncope, severe electrolyte disturbance), acute food refusal
  with rapid deterioration, recent suicide attempt or active intent—medical admission
  and multidisciplinary stabilization (medical + psychiatric + dietetic) required.
  [oai_citation:10‡NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng69?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

## Intervention / Response Framework (evidence-aligned immediate strategies)

- **Medical stabilization:** correct life-threatening electrolytes, monitor cardiac
  rhythm, treat dehydration, correct hypoglycaemia; consult internal medicine/medical ED
  and admit when indicated. Use refeeding precautions and monitoring for refeeding
  syndrome (thiamine, slow caloric repletion, frequent electrolyte checks).
  [oai_citation:11‡NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng69?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Safety planning:** collaborative, nonjudgmental safety plan for suicidality and
  self-harm risk; include crisis contacts, coping strategies, and agreed escalation
  steps. (If imminent risk, follow local legal pathways for involuntary admission where
  necessary.)
  [oai_citation:12‡National Institute of Mental Health](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/eating-disorders?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Brief psychoeducation & harm reduction:** normalize help-seeking, address pro-ED
  messaging, counsel about risks of purging, laxative misuse, and unsupervised
  weight-loss drugs (assess for GLP-1/anti-obesity agents and their effects on eating
  behavior).
  [oai_citation:13‡The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/04/ozempic-semaglutide-eating-disorders?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Nutrition & refeeding plan:** involve a dietitian; establish a monitored meal plan,
  set safe initial caloric targets adjusted for medical risk, and plan frequent
  electrolyte monitoring.
- **Psychological interventions (initial disposition):** for children/adolescents,
  Family-Based Treatment (FBT/Maudsley) is frontline for many with AN; for adults,
  evidence-based therapies include CBT-E for bulimia and binge-eating disorder,
  interpersonal therapy, and specialist approaches—refer when available.
  [oai_citation:14‡PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1414759/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Pharmacology:** use symptom-targeted medications where evidence supports (e.g., SSRI
  for bulimia or comorbid mood/anxiety), but recognize limited pharmacologic options for
  weight restoration in AN; consult psychiatry.
  [oai_citation:15‡NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng69?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Communication & Trauma-Informed Interaction Tips

- Ask directly, plainly, and nonjudgmentally about eating behaviors, weight-control
  behaviors, and suicidal thoughts; people often under-report due to shame.
  [oai_citation:16‡National Institute of Mental Health](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/eating-disorders?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- Use gender-affirming, culturally sensitive language; be mindful of neurodivergent
  sensory issues and rigid routines around food.
- Prioritize dignity and shared decision-making where capacity is intact; if capacity is
  impaired by malnutrition, document and act per local legal/ethical frameworks.
- Family/caregiver involvement: with consent (or when minor/depending on safety),
  involve family early—especially for adolescents where family-based approaches are
  effective.

- Safety plan summary, who received copy, and consent/limits of confidentiality
- Notifications: family, primary care, specialty teams, and time-stamped actions taken

---

## Care Coordination & Follow-up

- **Before discharge:** ensure clear safety plan, scheduled follow-up with
  eating-disorder specialist or community mental health (ideally within 48–72 hours),
  dietitian appointment, and explicit crisis instructions.
  [oai_citation:20‡NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng69?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Bridging contacts:** provide crisis hotline numbers and local eating-disorder
  resources (e.g., NEDA in the U.S., or local equivalents).
  [oai_citation:21‡National Eating Disorders Association](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/what-are-eating-disorders/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Handoffs:** send concise, structured referral with recent labs, weight trends, and
  the safety plan to receiving teams; use active outreach when no-show risk is high.
- **Monitoring:** consider remote check-ins, meal supervision supports, or day-program
  referral depending on severity and resources.

---

## Postvention and Staff Support

- After critical incidents (suicide attempts, medical crisis), conduct a structured
  debrief for staff, offer peer support and supervision, and provide clear steps to
  support continuity of care for the patient/family.
- For school-based or community exposures, provide age-appropriate outreach resources
  and limit sensational language; connect affected people to support services.

---

## Ethical & Legal Considerations

- Know local laws about consent, minors, and involuntary treatment when capacity is
  impaired by malnutrition.
- Respect confidentiality and discuss limits (safety concerns, duty to warn),
  documenting consent/declination for information-sharing.
- Be cautious about weight-centric messaging; avoid stigmatizing language and center
  recovery goals that include health and function.
- When prescribing or approving anti-obesity or appetite-suppressant medications, assess
  eating-disorder history and monitor for exacerbation.
