### üß© Definition and Core Themes
**Eating disorders** are serious, sometimes life-threatening mental health conditions characterized by persistent disturbances in eating behavior and related thoughts and emotions (e.g., extreme restriction, bingeing, compensatory behaviors, or severe avoidance of foods). They are transdiagnostic and present along continuums of severity, medical risk, and functional impact. Early detection and multi-domain intervention (medical, psychological, social) improve outcomes.  [oai_citation:0‚Ä°National Institute of Mental Health](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/eating-disorders?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Core assumptions and themes:
- Disorders reflect interactions between biology (genetic vulnerability, neurobiology, metabolic effects), psychology (body image, control, affect regulation), and social context (cultural weight norms, trauma, caregiving systems).  [oai_citation:1‚Ä°National Eating Disorders Association](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/what-are-eating-disorders/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- Presentations vary widely across gender, age, race, and body size; not all eating disorders involve low weight.  [oai_citation:2‚Ä°National Eating Disorders Association](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/what-are-eating-disorders/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### üåø Traits and Lived Experience
What it often feels like inside the experience:
- Intense preoccupation with food, body, weight, or eating rituals; cycles of shame, secrecy, and self-monitoring.  [oai_citation:3‚Ä°National Eating Disorders Association](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/what-are-eating-disorders/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- Confusion and ambivalence: care and fear can coexist ‚Äî for example, fear of medical consequences vs. fear of losing the disorder‚Äôs perceived benefits (control, identity, coping).  [oai_citation:4‚Ä°Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/eating-disorders/symptoms-causes/syc-20353603?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- Social isolation and identity impacts: relationships and community participation may be strained by secrecy, eating rituals, or medical appointments.  [oai_citation:5‚Ä°National Institute of Mental Health](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/eating-disorders?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Considerations for marginalized and neurodivergent people:
- Cultural and gender expectations change risk and help-seeking; neurodivergent sensory/rigidity profiles (e.g., ARFID-like patterns) may present differently and require adapted approaches.  [oai_citation:6‚Ä°National Eating Disorders Association](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/what-are-eating-disorders/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### üß† Nervous System and Parts Work Lens
**Polyvagal insights:** Persistent threat or dysregulation (hyperarousal or dorsal withdrawal) amplifies rigid control behaviors or dissociative eating responses; ventral-vagal safety and co-regulation support re-engagement with interoception and appetite cues.  [oai_citation:7‚Ä°BioMed Central](https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-023-00886-w?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Parts / IFS mapping:** Common internal roles:
- **Protector** ‚Äî enforces rules, rituals, and restriction to avoid emotional pain.  
- **Controller/Achiever** ‚Äî ties self-worth to rule-following and body metrics.  
- **Exile (Vulnerable Self)** ‚Äî holds shame, hunger, grief; often hidden and protected.  
Mapping these parts clarifies compassionate interventions (e.g., inviting Protectors to try alternate safety plans rather than removing them abruptly).  [oai_citation:8‚Ä°BioMed Central](https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-023-00886-w?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

### üíû Attachment and Relational Patterns
- Eating disorders often co-occur with attachment injuries: caregivers who invalidated bodily experience or emotions can leave people vulnerable to self-regulatory attempts through eating behaviors.  [oai_citation:9‚Ä°National Institute of Mental Health](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/eating-disorders?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- Relational repair and predictable caregiving (family-based approaches, structured support) are protective and, for adolescents, often central to effective treatment.  [oai_citation:10‚Ä°PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6764593/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- In adult relationships, partners may misinterpret behaviors as choice or attention-seeking ‚Äî psychoeducation and practical scaffolds (shared meal plans, negotiated boundaries) support co-regulation.

### üîÑ Misunderstandings and Reframes

| Myth | Reframe |
| --- | --- |
| Eating disorders are only about weight. | They are multifactorial illnesses involving biology, psychology, and social context; weight is one visible dimension.  [oai_citation:11‚Ä°National Eating Disorders Association](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/what-are-eating-disorders/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| People with eating disorders just need willpower. | Behaviors are maintained by neurobiological, emotional, and social reinforcements; targeted interventions build alternative coping and restore physiology.  [oai_citation:12‚Ä°National Institute of Mental Health](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/eating-disorders?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| Treatment is one-size-fits-all. | Evidence supports different modalities by age, diagnosis, and context (e.g., FBT for adolescents; CBT-based approaches like CBT-E for adults).  [oai_citation:13‚Ä°PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6764593/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |

### ‚öñÔ∏è Relational Challenges and Strengths

| Challenges | Strengths |
| --- | --- |
| Secrecy and shame ‚Üí underreporting and delayed help-seeking. | Strong recovery mentors, peer groups, and family support can increase engagement.  [oai_citation:14‚Ä°National Eating Disorders Association](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/what-are-eating-disorders/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| Medical risk (electrolyte imbalance, cardiac issues) requires integrated care. | Integrated teams (medical + mental health + nutrition) improve safety and outcomes.  [oai_citation:15‚Ä°National Institute of Mental Health](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/eating-disorders?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| Misunderstanding from partners/community ‚Üí conflict and ruptures. | Structured psychoeducation and shared rituals (mealtime supports) enable co-regulation and reduce blame.  [oai_citation:16‚Ä°PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6764593/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |

### üõ†Ô∏è Strategies, Prompts, and Practices
**Assessment prompts**
- "Describe current eating patterns and any compensatory behaviors (vomiting, laxatives, exercise) over the past 3 months."  [oai_citation:17‚Ä°NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK338301/table/introduction.t1/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- "What feelings typically come before and after episodes of restriction/bingeing?"  
- "What medical concerns or symptoms (lightheadedness, fainting, palpitations, GI issues) have you noticed?"

**Short, deployable practices**
1. **Safety triage**: screen immediately for red flags (syncope, rapid weight loss, vitals abnormalities, electrolyte issues) and refer for urgent medical assessment.  [oai_citation:18‚Ä°National Institute of Mental Health](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/eating-disorders?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
2. **Family-Based Treatment (FBT) elements (for adolescents):** empower caregivers to supervise meals and re-nourishment while preserving adolescent dignity; transition control back gradually.  [oai_citation:19‚Ä°PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6764593/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
3. **CBT-E / enhanced CBT** (for many adults): behavioral experiments, exposure to feared foods, cognitive restructuring about shape/weight, and relapse prevention.  [oai_citation:20‚Ä°Clinical Therapeutics](https://www.clinicaltherapeutics.com/article/S0149-2918%2820%2930511-7/fulltext?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
4. **Low-barrier mutual-aid actions:** shared meal plans, buddy check-ins, nonjudgmental food exposure groups, rotating organizers to reduce emotional labor.

**Short scripts**
- Intake permission: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm noticing [behavior]. I want to make sure we check on your physical safety and also talk about thoughts and feelings. Is that okay?‚Äù  
- Mealtime support opener: ‚ÄúWould it help to have someone share the meal with you this week? We can keep it small ‚Äî 10‚Äì15 minutes.‚Äù

### ü™¢ Associated Kinks
_(Omitted ‚Äî not central to this framework note. If working at the intersection of kink and eating disorders, emphasize consent, explicit safety, and multidisciplinary care to avoid triggering scripts.)_

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Consent, Safety & Negotiation
- Prioritize medical safety: unstable vitals or severe weight loss require urgent medical attention or inpatient care.  [oai_citation:21‚Ä°National Institute of Mental Health](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/eating-disorders?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- Consent for documentation and family involvement must be carefully negotiated; for minors, guardianship responsibilities differ by jurisdiction and clinical guidelines.  [oai_citation:22‚Ä°PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6764593/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- When community/partner supports are engaged, clarify roles, limits (non-clinical), and communication pathways to clinicians.

---

### üß≠ Roles, Archetypes & Dynamics
- **Rescuer caregiver** ‚Äî may overcompensate (take control of meals) and trigger adolescent autonomy struggles.  [oai_citation:23‚Ä°PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6764593/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **Perfectionist / Achiever** ‚Äî links identity to weight/control; often needs cognitive reframing and values work.  
- **Ambivalent partner** ‚Äî wants to help but fears saying the wrong thing; needs clear scripts and small tasks.

---

### üîÅ Scripts, Rituals & Repair
**Pre-meal micro-ritual (3‚Äì5 min):** set intention (safety + nourishment), name one small goal, agree on a post-meal check-in time.  
**Post-incident repair script:** ‚ÄúI see you‚Äôre upset after that meal/episode. I‚Äôm here to listen, not to fix. What would help ‚Äî space, distraction, or to talk?‚Äù  
**De-role practice:** after therapeutic refeeding or exposure, use a short grounding or identity-affirmation ritual to separate personhood from symptoms.

---

### üí† Mutual Aid & Collective Access
- Create rotating meal-buddy rosters to lower initiation burden.  
- Offer asynchronous check-ins (text/photo) for those with executive function barriers.  
- Map local sliding-scale clinicians, dietitians, and support groups; co-create emergency plans and contact lists.

---

### üåÄ Creative, Mythic & Spiritual Overlays
- Use metaphors (e.g., ‚Äúre-learning hunger as a language‚Äù) and narrative practices to externalize the disorder (narrative therapy) and create rites of passage for change (rituals marking milestones).

---

### üé≠ Symbolic Narrative & Story Mechanics
- Frame recovery arcs as gradual re-authoring: from secrecy/control ‚Üí co-regulation ‚Üí integration of needs and values. Use small, measurable quests (e.g., ‚Äúthree shared meals this week‚Äù) to create micro-achievement loops.

### üìò Glossary or Concept Index
- **ARFID:** Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder ‚Äî avoids or restricts food without body-image concerns; often sensory or appetite-based.  [oai_citation:24‚Ä°National Eating Disorders Association](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/what-are-eating-disorders/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **OSFED:** Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder ‚Äî clinically significant disordered eating not meeting full criteria for other categories.  [oai_citation:25‚Ä°National Eating Disorders Association](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/what-are-eating-disorders/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **CBT-E:** Enhanced cognitive behavioral therapy tailored for eating disorders.  [oai_citation:26‚Ä°Clinical Therapeutics](https://www.clinicaltherapeutics.com/article/S0149-2918%2820%2930511-7/fulltext?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
