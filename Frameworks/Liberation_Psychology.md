### üß© Definition and Core Themes

**Liberation Psychology** is a critical, social, and political approach to psychological theory and practice that originated in **Latin America** (primarily El Salvador) in the 1970s and 80s. Developed by **Ignacio Mart√≠n-Bar√≥**, it fundamentally critiques traditional Western psychology for its **individualistic, decontextualized, and ahistorical** focus.

- **Core Goal:** To shift the focus of psychology from the individual pathology of the oppressed to the **oppressive socio-political structures** (racism, poverty, violence, inequality) that are the root cause of psychological distress.
- **Ethical Stance:** It adopts a **"preferential option for the oppressed majorities,"** positioning psychological work as a tool for social justice, collective empowerment, and the transformation of unjust social realities.
- **Basis:** It is heavily influenced by **Liberation Theology** and the critical pedagogy of **Paulo Freire**.

### üß† Key Concepts and Transformative Praxis

Liberation Psychology is a framework for both critical analysis and action (_praxis_), aiming to create collective and individual well-being through social change.

#### 1. Conscientizaci√≥n (Critical Consciousness)

Borrowed from Paulo Freire, this is the central process of psychological liberation. It involves the active process of people:

- **Becoming aware** of the socio-political and historical forces that structure their lives and create their suffering.
- **Taking action** to challenge and transform these oppressive conditions. This links personal well-being to collective empowerment.

#### 2. De-ideologization

This is the critical analysis and dismantling of the **dominant ideologies** (e.g., fatalism, individualism, meritocracy) that are internalized by the oppressed. These ideologies often lead individuals to blame themselves for systemic issues, thereby maintaining the status quo. The goal is to replace these internalized oppressive narratives with a **critical realism** of their social condition.

#### 3. Recovery of Historical Memory

This involves facilitating a process where marginalized communities reclaim their suppressed or distorted histories of struggle, resistance, and trauma. Reclaiming this narrative is essential for developing a strong, integrated **collective identity** capable of resilience and future action.

#### 4. The New Praxis (Action-Oriented Methodology)

Liberation Psychology favors methodologies that involve psychologists working alongside, rather than on, the community:

- **Participatory Action Research (PAR):** Collaborative research designed and executed with the community to generate knowledge that directly benefits their liberation efforts.
- **Psychosocial Accompaniment:** A stance where the psychologist acts as an ally or companion, providing support and facilitating change within the context of the community's own social struggles and movements.
