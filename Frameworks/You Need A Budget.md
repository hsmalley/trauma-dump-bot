### üìù Definition and Core Concept

**YNAB** (You Need A Budget) is both a budgeting application and a financial methodology
based on the principle of **Zero-Based Budgeting** and the **Envelope System**. The core
idea is to change your relationship with money by making **intentional decisions** about
every dollar you possess _before_ you spend it.

Unlike traditional budgeting, which often forecasts future spending based on expected
income, YNAB only budgets the money you **currently have** in your bank accounts. This
system encourages being proactive, not reactive, with your finances.

### üèõÔ∏è The Four Rules of the YNAB Method

The YNAB methodology is encapsulated in four simple, yet powerful rules designed to
break the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle and reduce financial stress.

#### Rule 1: Give Every Dollar a Job

When money comes in, you must immediately assign it to a specific category (a "job")
based on your priorities. You keep allocating money until the "Ready to Assign" amount
is zero, meaning every dollar has a purpose‚Äîfrom rent and groceries to long-term savings
and discretionary spending.

#### Rule 2: Embrace Your True Expenses

Acknowledge non-monthly, irregular, or large expenses (e.g., car insurance, holiday
gifts, annual subscriptions, car maintenance) by breaking them down into small,
manageable **monthly savings goals** (sinking funds). This ensures that when the large,
inevitable bill arrives, the money is already set aside and it's not a financial
"emergency."

#### Rule 3: Roll with the Punches

This rule emphasizes **flexibility** and non-judgment. If you overspend in one budget
category (e.g., groceries), you simply move money from a less important or over-funded
category (e.g., dining out) to cover the overspending. The key is to **change your plan,
not abandon it**, and to avoid incurring debt to cover the difference.

#### Rule 4: Age Your Money

The ultimate goal is to reach a point where the money you are spending today is money
you earned last month (or even earlier). This creates a **buffer**, allowing you to fund
all of next month's categories on the first day of the month. The "Age of Money" metric
tracks the average number of days that passes between earning a dollar and spending it,
aiming for 30 days or more.

### üîë Core Principles in Action

- **Cash-Flow Based:** Only budget money you physically possess right now, forcing a
  focus on the present financial reality.
- **Prioritization:** Since money is a finite resource, assigning every dollar a job
  forces you to rank your priorities and make trade-offs.
- **No Guilt:** Rule 3 reframes overspending not as a moral failure, but as a signal
  that your plan needs adjustment, encouraging continuous engagement.

The video below offers a comprehensive step-by-step guide to setting up and using the
YNAB application and its method.
