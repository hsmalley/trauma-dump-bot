# Definition & Core Themes

**What it is:**
Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of antiretroviral medication by HIV-negative people to prevent acquisition of HIV. PrEP can be oral medication (daily or on-demand) or long-acting injectable formulations; it is one tool among many in a comprehensive sexual-health and harm-reduction strategy.

**Core themes:**

- Biomedical prevention: medication reduces susceptibility to HIV infection.
- Relationship & consent: PrEP shapes conversations about risk, intimacy, and shared prevention plans.
- Access and equity: availability, cost, stigma, and structural barriers determine who benefits.

# Traits & Lived Experience

**Common contexts people use PrEP:**

- People with HIV-positive partners seeking added protection.
- People with multiple partners or partners of unknown status.
- People who inject drugs and share equipment.
- People who prefer medication-based prevention over condoms for reasons of pleasure, intimacy, or adherence.

**Emotional textures:**

- Relief and reduced anxiety about HIV transmission for many users.
- Complexity in relationships: pride, secrecy, fears about judgment, or misinterpretation of PrEP as signaling infidelity.

# Clinical Overview (practical primer)

**Common PrEP options (2025 landscape):**

- **Oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + emtricitabine (TDF/FTC)** — widely prescribed, often generic, used daily or as-on-demand in some populations.
- **Oral tenofovir alafenamide + emtricitabine (TAF/FTC)** — alternative oral option with different indications in some jurisdictions.
- **Long-acting injectable cabotegravir (CAB-LA; brand: Apretude)** — administered intramuscularly on a schedule (initiation + every-2-month dosing) as an alternative for people who prefer or require non-daily dosing.
- **Emerging long-acting options** (e.g., lenacapavir and others) are under evaluation and some have received policy recommendations in 2025 in certain contexts.

**Effectiveness & limits:**

- When taken as prescribed, PrEP substantially reduces risk of sexual HIV acquisition (very high effectiveness) and reduces risk from injection exposures. PrEP does not protect against other STIs, and it requires regular testing and clinical follow-up.

# Nervous-System & Relational Lens

- **Anxiety reduction:** PrEP can lower anticipatory anxiety about transmission, which in turn supports calmer, more curious conversations about sex.
- **Activation & disclosure:** discussions about starting PrEP may activate shame, fear, or suspicion; use grounding and non-blaming language to support disclosure.
- **Repair & trust:** offering PrEP as a shared safety plan can be a repair move after a breach of condom agreements or uncertain testing histories.

# Attachment & Communication Patterns

- **Disclosure scripts:** provide neutral, values-focused language for discussing PrEP (see Strategy section).
- **Negotiation:** integrate PrEP decisions into broader relationship agreements (condom rules, testing cadence, STI prevention).
- **Autonomy:** respect individual choice—PrEP is personal health care and not inherently a reflection of partner fidelity or character.

# Misunderstandings & Reframes

**Common misunderstandings**

- _"PrEP is 100% effective for all exposures."_ No — it is highly effective when used correctly, but not absolute, and it does not prevent other STIs.
- _"PrEP is only for gay men."_ No — PrEP is for anyone at risk, including cisgender women, transgender people, people who inject drugs, and others.

**Helpful reframes**

- Frame PrEP as a harm-reduction choice (like a seatbelt), not a moral judgment.
- Treat PrEP decisions as clinical choices requiring testing and follow-up rather than private secrets.

# Strategies, Prompts & Practices (how to talk, plan, and support adherence)

**Clinical checklist for initiation (brief)**

- Confirm HIV-negative status with reliable testing before starting.
- Screen for acute HIV symptoms and evaluate recent high-risk exposure.
- Baseline renal function (for TDF-containing regimens) and hepatitis B status.
- Discuss pregnancy plans and offer relevant counseling.

**Partner conversation starters**

- "I’m considering PrEP because I want to reduce our risk and feel less anxious — can we talk about what that would look like for us?"
- "I’m on PrEP; it helps me feel safer when we don’t use condoms — I wanted you to know."

**Adherence supports**

- Use pill reminders, pharmacy sync, or calendar dosing for daily pills.
- For injectables, set clinic appointments at the time of injection and use appointment reminders.
- Normalize missed doses: have a non-shaming plan for missed pills and clear guidance for when to seek care/testing after a missed injection.

**Integration into relationship agreements**

- Clarify whether PrEP affects condom use decisions, STI screening frequency, and disclosure expectations.
- Create a shared plan for test intervals (e.g., 3 months for HIV/STIs per local guidance) and how to handle new partners.

# Monitoring & Follow-up (practical)

- **HIV testing** every 1–3 months depending on regimen and local guidance; immediate testing if symptoms arise.
- **Renal monitoring** for TDF-containing regimens at baseline and periodically.
- **STI screening** routinely (urogenital, pharyngeal, rectal as indicated).
- **Pregnancy monitoring** and counseling as needed for people who can become pregnant.

# Ethical & Access Concerns

- **Equity:** structural barriers (cost, insurance restrictions, clinic access) limit who can use PrEP; advocate for low-cost and community-based options.
- **Stigma & privacy:** concerns about being labeled promiscuous can deter uptake; provider language matters.
- **Informed consent:** ensure patients understand benefits, limitations, side effects, and the need for monitoring.

# Community & Harm-Reduction Notes

- Pair PrEP with other prevention tools: condoms, syringe services, PEP availability, and regular testing.
- Work with community organizations to provide culturally responsive PrEP education and navigation.

# Quick Reference Scripts

- **Clinician to patient:** "PrEP is a medication that can greatly reduce your chance of getting HIV. If you’re interested, we’ll test you today, check some labs, and make a plan that fits your life."
- **Partner disclosure:** "I’ve started PrEP to protect my health and ours. I’m happy to share what I learned and how it affects our decisions together."

# Glossary

- **PrEP:** pre-exposure prophylaxis.

# Notes on Framing

This framework is practical, non-judgmental, and harm-reduction focused. It is written to aid clinicians, community educators, and relationship workers in translating biomedical prevention into relational practice.
