# 🧨 Edge Play

**Edge Play** refers to kink activities that intentionally push boundaries of **risk, fear, trust, or taboo**. It includes practices that involve **heightened physical danger, emotional intensity, or psychological challenge**—and thus require **exceptional communication, containment, and consent rigor**.

What counts as “edge” is **subjective**—based on a person’s trauma history, body, culture, and emotional triggers.

> “Edge play is where consent, risk, and identity collide.”

## 🔐 Consent Practices for Edge Play

- **Risk Profiles**: Shared understanding of physical/emotional safety limits
- **Explicit Negotiation**: Detailed discussions of triggers, limits, opt-outs
- **Safewords + Safesigns**: Nonverbal or double-confirmation systems
- **Check-ins & Debriefing**: Post-scene conversations to assess impact and repair needs
- **Written Agreements or Role Clarifications**: Especially with CNC, TPE, or public dynamics

> _Edge play is where the difference between consensual power and abuse becomes razor-thin._ Integrity is essential.

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- What edges feel _arousing_ vs _harmful_ to me—and how do I know?
- What does “trust” look like when I’m approaching an edge?
- How do I repair or regroup when an edge was too far?
- Are there power dynamics (race, gender, age, authority) that add **unacknowledged risk**?
