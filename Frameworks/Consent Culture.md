# Consent Culture

## Overview

A values framework emphasizing ongoing, enthusiastic, informed consent; honors autonomy, boundaries, and power-awareness in all interactions.

## Core Principles

- Consent is active, specific, revocable, and informed
- Power differentials require extra care and transparency
- Boundaries protect connection; they arenâ€™t punishment

## Application

- Use explicit check-ins and opt-ins before sensitive topics
- Offer choices and clarify scope/limits; welcome 'no' and 'not yet'
- Document agreements; revisit as contexts change
