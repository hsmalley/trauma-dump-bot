### üß© Definition and Core Themes

**Restorative Circles** (or Restorative Justice/Practices) is a philosophy and practice that focuses on repairing the **harm** caused by conflict or crime, rather than focusing primarily on punishment or blame. It is a structured process that brings together those harmed, those who caused the harm, and the affected community members to collectively determine how to best repair the injury and prevent future occurrences.

- **Core Goal:** To shift the focus from **"What rule was broken and how should the person be punished?"** to **"Who was harmed, and what are the needs of those harmed and those who caused the harm?"**
- **Central Tenet:** Crime/Conflict is a violation of people and relationships, not merely a violation of the law or a rule. The central parties are the **victim(s)** and the **offender(s)**, not the state or the institution.
- **Accountability and Repair:** True accountability is achieved when the person who caused the harm **takes responsibility** for their actions and actively participates in making amends to repair the damage.

### üåø The Process and Structure

Restorative Circles are conducted using a structured, facilitated format designed to maximize safety and participation for all parties.

#### 1. The Circle Process

The most common practice is the **Community Conferencing Circle**, which involves:

- **Harm Acknowledgment:** The person harmed speaks first, detailing the event and describing the **impact** of the action on their life and feelings.
- **Accepting Responsibility:** The person who caused the harm acknowledges their actions and the resulting impact, without making excuses.
- **Collaborative Plan:** The entire circle works together to devise a **Restorative Plan**‚Äîconcrete steps the person who caused harm will take to repair the damage (e.g., apology, restitution, community service, behavioral changes).

#### 2. Three Pillars

- **Encounter:** Creating a safe space for those affected to meet and dialogue.
- **Repair:** Focusing on concrete steps to heal the injuries (physical, emotional, material).
- **Transformation:** Addressing the root causes and preventing reoccurrence through community/systemic change.

### üß† Psychological and Relational Impact

Restorative Circles are highly effective because they meet core psychological needs that traditional punitive systems fail to address.

- **Validation of Harm (Victim):** Being able to tell their full story, have the harm acknowledged, and participate in defining the solution is profoundly **validating** for the victim, which is crucial for trauma recovery.
- **Empathy and Accountability (Offender):** The face-to-face nature of the process forces the person who caused the harm to confront the **human impact** of their actions. This process moves them from abstract guilt to concrete **empathy**, which is a powerful catalyst for authentic, internal change.
- **De-escalation (PVT):** The circle format, with a neutral, non-judgmental **Facilitator** who models regulation and ensures every voice is heard, provides a strong **Ventral Vagal (Safe and Social)** cue, allowing highly emotional conversations to remain contained and productive.
- **Community Agency:** Engaging the community (friends, family, neighbors) shifts the burden of conflict resolution from isolated individuals back to the collective, strengthening social bonds.

### üõ†Ô∏è Strategies and Applications

Restorative Circles are applied in various settings to address a wide range of harms:

- **Schools:** Used for bullying, classroom disruption, and conflict between students or teachers, shifting from suspension to mediation and repair.
- **Criminal Justice:** Used for non-violent offenses, allowing victims to receive direct amends and reducing recidivism (the likelihood of reoffending) by focusing on rehabilitation.
- **Workplace/Organizational Conflict:** Used to address toxic work environments, microaggressions, or conflicts between team members by focusing on repairing relationships and setting new behavioral norms.
