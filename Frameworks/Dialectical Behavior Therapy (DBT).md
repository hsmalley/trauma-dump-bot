# ⚖️ Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)

**Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)** is a structured therapeutic model developed by Marsha Linehan to support people with intense emotions and relational distress. It balances **acceptance** and **change** using practical, skills-based tools across four core domains.

Originally designed for borderline personality disorder and chronic suicidality, DBT is now widely used in trauma, addiction, neurodivergence, and relationship work.

## 🔄 Core DBT Dialectic

> **"I’m doing the best I can"** _and_ **"I want to do better."**

DBT teaches that opposites can coexist. This dialectical stance reduces shame and creates space for both validation and growth.

## 🧩 The Four Core Skill Areas

### 1. **Mindfulness**

- Present-moment awareness and attention.

## 🧠 Nervous System & Trauma Lens

- DBT supports **window of tolerance** work and integrates well with somatic regulation.
- Some tools (e.g., distraction) may mask deeper dysregulation if not balanced with emotion processing.
- The dialectical frame ("both/and") helps resolve internal part conflicts (connects to [[IFS]]).
