# 🖤 BDSM

**BDSM** refers to a range of consensual practices involving **bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadism, and masochism**. It centers on **power exchange**, **sensation**, and **psychological play**—all rooted in negotiation, communication, and trust.

Contrary to mainstream assumptions, healthy BDSM often involves **more consent, structure, and communication** than non-kink interactions.

## 🔑 Core Principles

- [[Risk-Aware Consensual Kink (RACK)|RACK]]— Risk-Aware Consensual Kink
- [[Safe, Sane, and Consensual (SSC)|SSC]] — Safe, Sane, and Consensual
- [[Personal Responsibility, Informed Consensual Kink (PRICK)|PRICK]] — Personal Responsibility, Informed Consensual Kink

All acknowledge the presence of **risk** and emphasize **clear, informed, and revocable consent**.

## 🧠 Nervous System and Trauma Lens

- **Intentional Dysregulation + Repair**: Some scenes simulate threat but are held within co-regulated, agreed-upon containers.
- **Trauma-Informed Kink**: Includes aftercare, check-ins, and awareness of fawn/freeze dynamics.
- **Somatic Anchoring**: Grounding before/during/after scenes to support integration.

---

## 🧩 Roles and Power Dynamics

- **Top / Bottom**: Who gives or receives sensation.
- **Dominant / Submissive (D/s)**: Power control dynamics, can be erotic or lifestyle-based.
- **Switch**: Engages in both roles depending on context or partner.

> Power in BDSM is not _taken_—it is _entrusted_. The submissive often sets limits; the dominant follows them.

---

## 🛠 Practices and Structures

- **Negotiation Forms**: Clarify limits, triggers, aftercare needs, safewords.
- **Safewords**: Pre-agreed words to pause or stop (“Red = stop,” “Yellow = check-in”).
- **Aftercare**: Post-scene care to regulate, reconnect, and debrief.
- **Scene Dynamics**: May include rituals, roles, outfits, or psychological states (subspace, top drop).

---

## 🌐 Intersectional and Cultural Considerations

- **Power, race, gender, disability, class** all shape how BDSM is experienced and perceived.
- Marginalized folks may experience unique risks when engaging with vulnerability, submission, or control.

---

## 🔄 Integration with Other Frameworks

- **Consent Culture**: Emphasizes pre-negotiation, safewords, and revocability.
- **Polyvagal Theory**: Scenes intentionally move between arousal states with safety anchors.
- **IFS**: Helps map parts (e.g., protector vs pleasure-seeker) that show up in kink play.
- **Boundary Models**: Supports clarity in what is and isn’t negotiable.

## 💬 Prompts for Reflection

- What roles or dynamics feel empowering, healing, or thrilling?
- How do I distinguish surrender from compliance or override?
- What does trust look like before, during, and after a scene?
- How do I prepare for, enter, and exit altered states (e.g., subspace, top drop)?
