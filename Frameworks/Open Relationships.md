# 🔓 Open Relationships

**Open Relationships** are a form of **Ethical Non-Monogamy (ENM)** where partners agree to **romantic and/or sexual experiences with others** outside their primary relationship. Unlike polyamory, which often centers emotional connections with multiple people, open relationships typically **prioritize one core relationship** while allowing for external exploration.

They vary widely in rules, goals, and emotional range—but all center **consent, honesty, and mutual agreement**.

## 🧠 Core Values

### 1. **Consent-Based Flexibility**

- Agreements are co-created—not assumed or imposed.
- Both partners can renegotiate terms over time.

### 2. **Primary Connection + Openness**

- Typically involves a “home base” partnership (emotional/nesting/romantic) with space for other experiences.
- Some open relationships are sexual-only; others include emotional bonds.

### 3. **Honesty & Communication**

- Regular check-ins, emotional updates, and boundary clarity are essential.

## 🔀 Common Variations

| Type                             | Description                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sexually Open**                | External partners allowed for sex, not romance.                        |
| **Open with Conditions**         | Specific agreements about types of partners, frequency, or activities. |
| **Exploratory**                  | Open status used to explore identity, kinks, or healing.               |
| **Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell (DADT)** | Limited sharing about external encounters (can support or harm trust). |

## 🛠 Practices & Agreements

- **Boundaries**: Safer sex practices, emotional disclosures, time logistics.
- **Check-Ins**: “How are you feeling about our agreements lately?”
- **Jealousy Skills**: Self-inquiry, reassurance, regulation, naming needs.
- **Rupture & Repair**: Agreements may be stretched or broken—repair is essential.

---

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

- **Uneven Access or Consent**: One partner “permits” the other—can mask power imbalance.
- **Avoiding Emotional Bonds**: Suppressing feelings to “protect” the core relationship can lead to shame or rupture.
- **Using Openness to Avoid Conflict**: “Opening up” won’t fix existing relational fractures.

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- What does “openness” mean to me—freedom, threat, exploration?
- Where do I need reassurance, and where do I need freedom?
- What kinds of experiences are we open to—and why?
- How do I want to be supported after external encounters?
