# Relational Theory

## Overview

Emphasizes mutuality, context, and the co-construction of meaning; growth occurs through relationships and attuned connection rather than individual isolation.

## Core Principles

- Mutual empathy and authenticity foster development
- Power and context shape interactional patterns
- Disconnections are inevitable; repair restores connection

## Application

- Center the relationship as the 'client' during analysis
- Prioritize repair sequences when misattunements occur
- Track both subjective experience and the relational field
