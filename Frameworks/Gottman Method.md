# 🧪 The Gottman Method

The **Gottman Method** is a research-based relationship framework developed by John and Julie Gottman. Based on over four decades of observational research, it provides concrete tools for improving **communication, conflict repair, emotional connection, and relational longevity**.

The model is best known for identifying the **“Four Horsemen”** of relational breakdown, along with practical antidotes.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### 1. **Love Maps**

- Knowing each other’s inner world: hopes, fears, triggers, goals.
- Practice: Regular curiosity and attunement.

### 2. **Bids for Connection**

- Small or large requests for attention, affection, or support.
- Healthy couples **turn toward** bids (even subtle ones) more often.

### 3. **Conflict Repair**

- Repair attempts are active efforts to de-escalate or reconnect.
- Gottman found that the _success of repair, not the presence of conflict_, predicts relationship strength.

## 🐎 The Four Horsemen of Disconnection

1. **Criticism**  
   Global attacks on character (“You always…” “You’re so selfish…”).  
   → _Antidote: Use gentle start-up with “I” statements and specific behavior._

2. **Contempt**  
   Disrespect, mocking, or moral superiority (eye-rolling, sarcasm).  
   → _Antidote: Build appreciation and express needs with care._

3. **Defensiveness**  
   Denying responsibility, counterattacking, or playing victim.  
   → _Antidote: Own your part, however small, and stay open._

4. **Stonewalling**  
   Withdrawing, shutting down, or going numb.  
   → _Antidote: Take breaks, self-soothe, and re-enter when regulated._
