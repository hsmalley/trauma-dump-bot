## Overview

The **Gottman Method** is a research‑based couples therapy model developed by John and Julie Gottman, grounded in decades of observational studies on what makes relationships succeed or fail. It emphasizes building relational strength, fostering positive sentiment, and managing conflict rather than eliminating it.

## Core Concepts

2. Share Fondness & Admiration
3. Turn Toward Instead of Away
4. The Positive Perspective
