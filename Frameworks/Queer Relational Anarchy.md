# 🏳️‍🌈 Queer Relational Anarchy (QRA)

**Queer Relational Anarchy (QRA)** is a radical relationship framework that blends **relational anarchy** with queer theory and anti-assimilationist politics. It rejects hierarchies, ownership, and social scripts in favor of **mutual care, autonomy, and chosen connection**—especially among queer, trans, disabled, and neurodivergent communities.

More than a nonmonogamous model, QRA asks:

> “What would my relationships look like if I never again had to perform normativity?”

## 🧠 Core Values

| Value                            | Description                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Anti-Normativity**             | Rejection of societal scripts (romance, gender roles, couplehood as goal)                     |
| **Autonomy + Interdependence**   | Each relationship defines its own terms—fluid, consensual, contextual                         |
| **Queerness as Framework**       | Embraces fluidity, resistance, chosen kinship, and nonbinary logic                            |
| **Relationship Pluralism**       | No hierarchy between romantic, platonic, sexual, or care connections                          |
| **Liberation, Not Assimilation** | Opposes respectability politics, “progress narratives,” and assimilation into dominant models |

## 🔄 Practices & Tools

- **Relationship Mapping** – Visualizing connections beyond “partner” or “friend”
- **Explicit Agreements** – Co-creating terms for closeness, care, touch, intimacy, commitment
- **Consent-Based Connection** – Mutual, evolving, non-assumptive
- **Check-Ins & Debriefing** – Ongoing relational care and honesty
- **Naming Needs Without Scripts** – Voicing desire without coercion or default roles
- **Non-Ownership Language** – “My person” becomes “someone I choose to show up for”

## ⚠️ Pitfalls & Watchpoints

| Challenge                        | Description                                               |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Anarchy ≠ Avoidance**          | Not a license for neglect, ghosting, or abandoning care   |
| **Power Hiding**                 | Invisible hierarchies can still exist—transparency is key |
| **Idealism Burnout**             | It’s okay to have structure, needs, or longings           |
| **Queerphobia in Relationships** | Even anarchic spaces can replicate cishet norms           |

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- Where am I replicating scripts I don’t believe in?
- What kinds of connection feel most nourishing, and how do I name them?
- What would freedom _with_ care feel like in my relationships?
- Who taught me what “real” love looks like—and do I agree?
