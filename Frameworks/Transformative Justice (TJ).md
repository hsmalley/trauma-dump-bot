# 🌱 Transformative Justice (TJ)

**Transformative Justice (TJ)** is a community-based approach to harm that seeks to **address violence without relying on punishment, incarceration, or state systems**. It focuses on **healing, accountability, safety, and systemic transformation**—especially within communities impacted by oppression, trauma, and marginalization.

> “Transform the conditions that allowed harm to occur—not just the people involved.”

## 🧠 Core Principles

| Principle                    | Description                                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Community Accountability** | The community—not just the state or individual—is responsible for responding to harm  |
| **Root Cause Analysis**      | Harm is addressed in the context of systemic, generational, and structural oppression |
| **Non-Punitive**             | Rejects revenge, shame, and isolation as justice                                      |
| **Healing-Centered**         | Supports both those who were harmed and those who caused harm                         |
| **Self-Determination**       | Communities and individuals define safety and justice for themselves                  |

## 🔄 Key Components

- **Support for Survivors** – Validate, empower, and meet material/emotional needs
- **Accountability Pathways** – Those who cause harm are supported to take responsibility, make amends, and transform
- **Collective Safety Planning** – Ongoing practices of care, boundary-setting, and risk assessment
- **Skill-Building** – Communication, consent, trauma literacy, and de-escalation
- **Systems Change** – Address conditions like poverty, racism, ableism, or isolation that allow harm to persist

## ⚠️ Challenges & Misuse

| Issue                        | Risk                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mimicking Carceral Logic** | TJ is not about replicating trials, guilt, or exile                               |
| **Over-Reliance on Victims** | Survivors are not obligated to facilitate accountability                          |
| **Under-Resourcing**         | Community support networks often lack funding, training, or safety infrastructure |
| **Weaponized “Call-Ins”**    | TJ can be distorted into performative or punitive callout culture                 |
