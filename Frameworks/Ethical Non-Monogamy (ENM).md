# ‚ôæÔ∏è Ethical Non-Monogamy (ENM)

**Ethical Non-Monogamy (ENM)** refers to any relationship structure that **consciously and consensually includes more than one romantic and/or sexual partner**. ENM prioritizes **honesty, consent, and agency**‚Äîin contrast to secrecy or coercion.

ENM is not a singular identity or practice‚Äîit‚Äôs an umbrella term encompassing many relationship styles, including **polyamory, open relationships, relationship anarchy, swinging**, and more.

## üß† Core Values

### 1. **Informed Consent**

- Everyone involved agrees to the structure with full information and autonomy.
- Includes the freedom to renegotiate or exit.

### 2. **Agency & Choice**

- Emphasizes **relational design** over default scripts.
- Recognizes diverse needs, identities, and desires.

### 3. **Transparency & Communication**

- Honest, ongoing conversation about boundaries, feelings, and logistics.
- Disclosure ‚â† oversharing; privacy ‚â† secrecy.

### 4. **Mutual Care & Accountability**

- Considers **relational impact** even when needs diverge.
- Prioritizes repair, emotional attunement, and integrity.

## üõ† Skills & Practices

- Relationship check-ins (weekly or structured prompts).
- Explicit boundary discussions (sexual health, time, emotional availability).
- Naming agreements vs. assumptions.
- Capacity checks: ‚ÄúDo I have space for another dynamic emotionally/logistically?‚Äù
- Conflict repair without shame: ‚ÄúHow do we return to trust after rupture?‚Äù

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Challenges

- **Jealousy**: Often signals unmet needs (belonging, reassurance, visibility).
- **Attachment Styles**: ENM can amplify anxious or avoidant patterns.
- **Comparison & Hierarchy**: Requires clear agreements around roles and expectations.
- **Time & Energy Scarcity**: Careful resource-sharing needed to avoid burnout.

## üí¨ Reflection Prompts

- What stories have I inherited about love, ownership, and scarcity?
- Am I choosing this structure out of freedom‚Äîor fear?
- How do I want to be held, seen, and prioritized in this relationship?
- What do boundaries mean for me‚Äîand how do I communicate them?
