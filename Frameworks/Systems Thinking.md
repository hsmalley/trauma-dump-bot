# Systems Thinking

## Overview

A lens that views problems as products of interacting parts, feedback loops, and delays rather than isolated events.

## Core Principles

- Look for reinforcing and balancing feedback loops
- Small, well-placed interventions (leverage points) shift systems
- Beware of linear cause–effect oversimplification

## Application

- Map conversational loops (trigger → reaction → counter-reaction)
- Identify leverage points (pause, meta-communication, time-outs)
- Design experiments and measure system response, not blame
