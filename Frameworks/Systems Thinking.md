# Systems Thinking

## Overview
A lens that views problems as products of interacting parts, feedback loops, and delays rather than isolated events.

## Core Principles
- Look for reinforcing and balancing feedback loops  
- Small, well-placed interventions (leverage points) shift systems  
- Beware of linear cause–effect oversimplification  

## Application
- Map conversational loops (trigger → reaction → counter-reaction)  
- Identify leverage points (pause, meta-communication, time-outs)  
- Design experiments and measure system response, not blame
