# 🧠 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

**Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** is a structured, present-focused therapeutic model that targets the relationship between **thoughts, feelings, and behaviors**. It helps individuals identify and shift unhelpful thinking patterns and behavior cycles that contribute to distress.

---

## 🔄 CBT Core Model

**Situation → Thought → Emotion → Behavior → Outcome**

- External or internal events trigger automatic thoughts.
- Thoughts shape how we feel.
- Feelings drive behaviors.
- Behaviors reinforce beliefs—creating feedback loops.

---

## 🔎 Cognitive Distortions

CBT targets habitual, often unconscious **thinking traps** that distort perception. Examples include:

- **All-or-Nothing Thinking**: “If I’m not perfect, I’m a failure.”
- **Catastrophizing**: Expecting the worst to happen.
- **Mind Reading**: Assuming others are judging or rejecting you.
- **Overgeneralization**: “This always happens to me.”
- **Should Statements**: Rigid expectations of self or others.

---

## 🛠 CBT Tools & Techniques

- **Thought Records**: Tracking situations, automatic thoughts, emotions, and alternative responses.
- **Cognitive Restructuring**: Challenging and reframing distortions with evidence-based thinking.
- **Behavioral Experiments**: Testing beliefs through planned actions.
- **Exposure Work**: Gradual desensitization to feared situations or emotions.
- **Activity Scheduling**: Building rewarding and mood-enhancing behaviors.

---

## 💬 Relational Applications

- **Reframing interpersonal triggers**: “What am I telling myself this means?”
- **Breaking conflict loops**: Understanding how interpretations fuel escalation.
- **Differentiating emotion vs story**: “What am I feeling vs what am I thinking?”
- **Challenging fused identity narratives**: “I am too much” → “I’m having a critical thought.”

---

## 🧠 Nervous System Considerations

- Works well alongside **somatic regulation**—CBT alone may bypass stored trauma.
- Can be over-intellectualizing for some neurodivergent or trauma-impacted individuals.
- Pairing CBT with **mindfulness** and **embodiment** enhances integration.

---

## 🔄 Integration with Other Frameworks

- Pairs well with **DBT** (adds emotion regulation) and **ACT** (adds acceptance/defusion).
- Supports **IFS** by identifying manager or critic parts.
- Useful in **Consent Culture** for unpacking internalized scripts and self-talk.

---

## 🔁 Reflection Prompts

- What’s the story I’m telling myself about this?
- What evidence supports and challenges this thought?
- Is this thought helpful, kind, or wise?
- What action could align better with my values?
