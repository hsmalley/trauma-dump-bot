# 🛡️ Trauma-Informed Care (TIC)

**Trauma-Informed Care (TIC)** is a foundational framework for interacting with others—especially in caregiving, clinical, educational, and community settings—that **prioritizes safety, empowerment, and choice**. It acknowledges the **pervasive impact of trauma** and designs relationships, services, and environments to avoid re-traumatization and support resilience.

TIC is not a specific technique—it’s a **paradigm shift** in how we understand behavior, regulation, and healing.

## 🧠 Core Principles (SAMHSA)

1. **Safety**
   - Physical, emotional, and cultural safety.
   - Predictability, consistency, clear boundaries.

2. **Trustworthiness & Transparency**
   - Clear communication; honesty about intentions, limits, and power.

3. **Peer Support**
   - Shared lived experience as a source of connection and validation.

4. **Collaboration & Mutuality**
   - Flatten hierarchies; center co-creation and choice.

5. **Empowerment, Voice & Choice**
   - Support autonomy, agency, and skill-building.

6. **Cultural, Historical & Gender Acknowledgment**
   - Recognize systemic and identity-based trauma and adapt accordingly.

## 🔍 What Trauma-Informed Care _Looks Like_

- Asking “What happened to you?” instead of “What’s wrong with you?”
- Designing systems that accommodate nervous system diversity.
- Recognizing survival strategies (e.g., shutdown, fawn) as adaptations—not problems.
- Holding **boundaries** with compassion, not control.

---

## 🧠 Integration with Nervous System Work

- Trauma often dysregulates the autonomic nervous system.
- TIC practices increase access to **co-regulation**, **containment**, and **self-regulation**.
- Aligns with frameworks like [[Polyvagal Theory]], [[Somatic Experiencing (SE)]], and [[Internal Family Systems (IFS)]].

## 🛠 Practice Examples

- Offer choices: “Would you prefer to meet today or tomorrow?”
- Name pacing: “This is a lot—we can pause anytime.”
- Validate resistance: “It makes sense that trust feels hard here.”
- Share power: “How would you like to approach this together?”

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- Where do I assume safety instead of checking for it?
- How do I hold structure _with_ flexibility and consent?
- What power do I hold—and how can I share or soften it?
- What implicit trauma stories might be shaping this dynamic?
