# Suicidal Ideation — Framework Notes

> Compact, evidence-aligned clinical framework for assessing, stabilizing, and planning
> care for people experiencing suicidal ideation. Designed as a practical reference for
> clinicians, care teams, and informed non-clinical responders.

---

## Purpose

- Provide a rapid-access, clinically grounded framework for assessing suicide risk and
  creating an immediate safety plan.
- Support consistent documentation, disposition decisions, and follow-up planning.

## Scope & Audience

- Intended for use in emergency departments, outpatient mental health, primary care,
  school-based health, crisis teams, and multidisciplinary care coordination.
- Not a substitute for advanced clinical training or local protocols. Always follow
  legal/organizational requirements.

## Quick Immediate Safety Checklist (first 5 minutes)

1. Are they in immediate danger right now? (access to means, current plan, intent,
   timeline)
2. If yes to any: maintain safe environment, call emergency services, and engage crisis
   resources.
3. If no immediate danger: move to structured assessment (below) while remaining
   empathetic and nonjudgmental.
4. Ask permission to contact supports if person is comfortable.
5. Create or update a written safety plan before discharge/transfer.

---

## Structured Risk Assessment (core domains)

- **Ideation:** frequency, intensity, duration, controllability (thoughts vs. urges).
- **Intent:** does the person want to die? Have they taken steps toward acting on the
  thought?
- **Plan:** specificity, lethality, access to means, imminence (when/how).
- **Preparatory behavior:** rehearsals, stockpiling, writing notes, giving away
  possessions.
- **History:** prior attempts (strongest single predictor), self-harm, hospitalizations.
- **Psychiatric state:** mood, psychosis, agitation, hopelessness, anxiety, substance
  use.
- **Protective factors:** reasons for living, social support, future orientation,
  treatments engaged.
- **Contextual:** cultural factors, legal risks, recent losses, isolation, access to
  healthcare.

**Screening tools to consider (use per local policy):** brief screening (PHQ-9 item 9),
formal tools for deeper assessment (C-SSRS or equivalent structured interview).

---

## Risk Stratification (practical triage)

- **Low acute risk:** passive ideation, no intent/plan, strong supports, safe
  environment — outpatient follow-up within 24–72 hours, safety plan, trusted contact
  identified.
- **Moderate risk:** active ideation with intermittent intent or non-specific plan, some
  access to means, limited supports — consider brief hospitalization vs. intensive
  outpatient/crisis follow-up, safety plan, means restriction, close contact (daily
  check-ins or next-day contact).
- **High/Immediate risk:** active ideation with intent and specific plan, imminent
  timeframe, access to lethal means, severe agitation/psychosis or recent attempt —
  emergent intervention (hospitalization, 1:1 staff observation, involuntary hold if
  legally indicated), immediate safety planning and means removal.

_This is a decision aid, not a legal standard — use alongside clinical judgment and
local laws._

## Safety Planning (Stanley & Brown model — brief intervention structure)

1. **Warning signs** — what the person notices first (thoughts, sensations, triggers).
2. **Internal coping strategies** — things they can do alone to distract/soothe
   (breathing, grounding, sensory activities).
3. **Social contacts & places for distraction** — people/places to call or go to when
   alone but not ready to ask for help.
4. **People to ask for help** — names and phone numbers of trusted contacts who can
   provide support.
5. **Professional and crisis resources** — local crisis lines, 988 (in the U.S.),
   clinician contacts, emergency services.
6. **Making the environment safe (means reduction)** — remove/access-control steps for
   firearms, medications, poisons, high places, etc.
7. **Agreement to follow-up / signals for escalation** — what steps will be taken if
   crisis escalates (who will call whom, timeframes).

_Make this a written, portable document the person can carry or access on a phone.
Involve family/supports when appropriate and with consent._

## Brief Interventions & Immediate Strategies

- **Collaborative Safety Planning** (see above) — brief, evidence-aligned,
  collaborative.
- **Means restriction counseling** — practical negotiation about removing lethal means;
  provide concrete steps and resources (temporary transfer of firearms, lockboxes, safe
  storage prescriptions).
- **Coping skills coaching** — grounding, paced breathing, behavioral activation, DBT
  distress-tolerance skills (if trained).
- **Address substances** — immediate reduction of intoxication risk and plan for
  withdrawal or safety if indicated.
- **Medication considerations** — urgent psychopharmacology consult if severe agitation,
  psychosis, or depression requiring medication; preserve short-term safety while
  arranging follow-up.
- **Brief psychoeducation** — normalize crisis as treatable, reduce shame, reinforce
  protective factors (relationships, responsibilities, goals).

## Communication & Trauma-Informed Interaction Tips

- Use calm, direct, nonjudgmental language. Validate feelings without reinforcing
  intent.
- Ask about suicidal thoughts directly and plainly (e.g., "Have you had thoughts about
  killing yourself?").
- Avoid minimizing language ("You’ll be fine"); instead reflect and acknowledge
  distress.
- Use gender-affirming and identity-aware language. Be mindful that stigma increases
  risk.
- Work from a stance of curiosity and collaboration: build agency into plans.

---

## Documentation Template (minimum fields)

- Date/time, clinician, setting
- Presenting concern and verbatim suicidal statements (if given)
- Assessment tool used (e.g., C-SSRS) and findings
- Ideation/intent/plan/access to means/history
- Protective factors and supports listed by name and contact
- Safety plan summary and who received a copy
- Disposition decision and rationale (admit/observe/discharge + follow-up plan)
- Communication with family/guardian/other providers (consent/limits)
- Specific steps taken to reduce means/access

---

## Care Coordination & Follow-up

- **Before discharge:** ensure safety plan, remove/limit means, confirm follow-up
  appointment within 48–72 hours (or sooner if risk warrants), provide emergency
  contacts.
- **Outreach:** active outreach after discharge (phone check-ins, SMS, or scheduled
  calls) in first 1–2 weeks; use collaborative outreach models when possible.
- **Hand-offs:** send concise, urgent summary to receiving clinician/team; include
  safety plan and recent risk details.

---

## Postvention and Staff Support

- Offer immediate debriefing and peer support for staff after critical incidents.
- Postvention planning for families and communities after attempts/completed suicide:
  provide resources and referrals to bereavement support.

---

## Ethical & Legal Considerations

- Know local laws about involuntary holds and duty to warn/protect.
- Respect confidentiality where possible; document limits of confidentiality discussed
  with the person.
- Obtain consent for sharing safety plan with supports when feasible.
