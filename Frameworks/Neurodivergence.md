### üß© Definition and Core Themes

**Neurodivergence** (ND) refers to the idea that there is natural, biological variation in the human brain regarding **sociability, learning, attention, mood, and other mental functions**. The term was coined by activist Kassiane Asasumasu. It is an umbrella term for conditions like **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Tourette Syndrome, and others**.

The underlying philosophy is **Neurodiversity**‚Äîthe perspective that these variations are a natural and valuable form of human difference, similar to biodiversity or cultural diversity, and should not be inherently pathologized as disorders that must be cured.

- **Core Goal:** To shift the dominant cultural narrative from a **medical model** (ND is a deficit) to a **social model** (ND is a difference, and disability arises from an inflexible environment).
- **Neurotypical (NT):** The term used to describe individuals whose brain functions fall within the range of what is considered "typical" or standard in a given society.
- **Double Empathy Problem:** A concept within autism research suggesting that difficulties in communication and social interaction are often a two-way problem (between NT and ND individuals) due to different communication styles, rather than solely a deficit on the part of the autistic person.

### üåø Traits and Lived Experience

The lived experience of a neurodivergent person is often one of high internal effort, masking, and navigating an environment designed for a different cognitive style.

- **Masking and Camouflage:** A prominent trait, particularly in autistic and ADHD individuals, is **masking**‚Äîthe conscious or unconscious suppression of natural neurodivergent behaviors (e.g., stimming, sensory avoidance) to appear "normal" in social settings. This effort leads to significant mental exhaustion, burnout, and psychological distress.
- **Intensity and Sensory Differences:** Experiences are often characterized by heightened intensity, whether in focus (hyper-focus in ADHD/Autism), emotion, or sensory processing (hypersensitivity to sound, light, or texture).
- **Strengths-Based View:** The framework emphasizes the strengths often associated with ND, such as pattern recognition, system thinking, deep integrity, intense creativity, and hyper-vigilance/attention to detail.

### üß† Nervous System and Parts Work Lens

Neurodivergence often involves a nervous system that is chronically closer to its threshold for dysregulation.

- **Sensory Overload and Thresholds (PVT):** Many ND traits are linked to a lower threshold for **Ventral Vagal (Safe and Social)** system maintenance. Sensory stimuli that are easily processed by NT individuals can quickly push an ND nervous system into **Sympathetic Hyper-arousal (Overwhelm/Meltdown)** or **Dorsal Vagal Shutdown (Freeze/Dissociation)**.
- **Manager and Firefighter Parts (IFS):** Masking is largely the work of highly active **Manager Parts** (e.g., The Perfectionist, The People-Pleaser) working overtime to prevent social rejection or shame. **Firefighter Parts** (e.g., addiction, avoidance, dissociation) rush in to manage the intense burnout caused by constant masking.
- **Self-Regulation Strategies:** Stimming (self-stimulatory behavior) is reframed not as a symptom of disorder, but as a critical, internal **self-regulation tool** used to calm and organize the nervous system.

### üíû Attachment and Relational Patterns

Neurodivergence complicates attachment dynamics, particularly due to differences in non-verbal communication and emotional processing.

- **Attunement Challenges:** Attunement in relationships can be challenging when one or both partners operate with different communication hardware. Misunderstandings of subtle non-verbal cues (due to the **Double Empathy Problem**) can lead to cycles of relational rupture.
- **Need for Explicit Communication:** Secure attachment in ND-NT or ND-ND relationships relies heavily on **explicit, verbal communication** of needs, intentions, and boundaries, often compensating for difficulties in implicit (non-verbal) attunement. The **Boundary Models** must be highly clear and functional.
- **Emotional Safety:** The neurodivergent person requires a relational container that is radically non-judgmental and allows them to drop the **mask**, which is the highest form of relational trust and acceptance, facilitating the development of **Earned Secure Attachment**.

| "Autistic people lack empathy."     | "Autistic people may process and express empathy differently (e.g., struggling with implicit social cues) but often experience **hyper-empathy** or intense emotional responsiveness, leading to overwhelm."                                     |
| "ADHD is just a lack of willpower." | "ADHD is a difference in **executive function** and a neurochemical regulation disorder (dopamine/norepinephrine). It is not a moral failing or a lack of motivation, but a difficulty in regulating attention, activation, and follow-through." |

| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Relational Burnout:** The effort of masking and navigating the NT world leads to chronic fatigue, which impairs relational energy and the capacity for emotional availability.         | **Deep Integrity and Honesty:** Many neurodivergent individuals place high value on directness, honesty, and justice, fostering relationships built on trust and clear communication. |
| **Environmental Barriers:** The world (schools, workplaces, public spaces) is often highly inaccessible to sensory, attention, and executive function needs, creating persistent stress. | **Hyper-focus and Detail:** The ability to intensely focus and master complex systems or specialized interests can be a major relational and professional asset.                      |

### üõ†Ô∏è Strategies, Prompts, and Practices

- **Micro-Skill (Body Doubling):** For executive function challenges (often ADHD/Autism), a partner working nearby can act as a **Body Doubler**‚Äîa silent, non-judgmental presence that helps activate focus and sustained attention.
- **Prompt (The Sensory Check-in):** In any potential conflict, start with a sensory check to reduce overwhelm: _"On a scale of 1 to 10, what is your current energy level? Is there anything you need to turn off (lights, noise) before we continue talking?"_
- **Micro-Skill (Externalizing Executive Function):** Using visual lists, time tracking, colored folders, and external physical organization systems to compensate for internal organizational challenges.
