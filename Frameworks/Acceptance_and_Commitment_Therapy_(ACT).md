# Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)

## Overview

Therapeutic model that emphasizes psychological flexibility through acceptance, mindfulness, and value-based action.

## Core Principles

- Cognitive defusion: detaching from unhelpful thoughts
- Acceptance: allowing thoughts and feelings without avoidance
- Contact with the present moment: mindful awareness
- Self-as-context: observing self beyond content
- Values: clarifying and committing to meaningful directions
- Committed action: behavior aligned with values

## Application

- Use values cards or journaling to clarify relational priorities
- Defuse from reactive thoughts during conflict
- Notice experiential avoidance patterns and reorient to values
