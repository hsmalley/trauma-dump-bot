# 🤝 Attachment Theory

**Attachment Theory** explores how early relational experiences shape internal models of safety, connection, and intimacy. Developed by John Bowlby and expanded by Mary Ainsworth, it provides a foundational lens for understanding emotional regulation, trust, and vulnerability in relationships.

## 🧠 Core Attachment Styles

Attachment styles reflect patterns of bonding developed in early caregiving and often play out in adult relationships:

### 1. **Secure Attachment**

- Comfortable with intimacy and autonomy.
- Can express needs and respond to others with empathy.
- Typically formed with responsive, attuned caregivers.

### 2. **Anxious (Preoccupied) Attachment**

- Hyper-focused on closeness and fear of abandonment.
- Often experiences emotional volatility and seeks reassurance.
- Formed with inconsistent caregiving.

### 3. **Avoidant (Dismissive) Attachment**

- Downplays need for closeness; prioritizes independence.
- Difficulty accessing or expressing emotion.
- Often linked to emotionally unavailable or dismissive caregivers.

### 4. **Disorganized (Fearful-Avoidant) Attachment**

- Experiences push-pull dynamics: craves closeness but fears it.
- Often results from trauma or frightening caregiving.
- Tends to show high dysregulation and confusion in relationships.
