# 🕊️ Restorative Justice (RJ)

**Restorative Justice (RJ)** is a relational, community-based approach to addressing harm that centers **accountability, repair, and reintegration**, rather than punishment. It brings together those who were harmed, those who caused harm, and impacted communities to **acknowledge impact, take responsibility, and co-create healing outcomes**.

Often used in schools, communities, and some legal settings, RJ is rooted in **indigenous practices of communal repair and interdependence**.

> “Justice is not served by isolation, but by connection and repair.”

| **Voluntary Participation**   | All parties engage with informed, uncoerced consent              |
| **Voice & Validation**        | Those harmed speak to their impact and needs                     |
| **Responsibility, Not Guilt** | Emphasis on amends and future repair, not shame                  |

## ⚠️ Scope & Misuse

| Risk                  | Clarification                                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Not a Shortcut**    | RJ is not a fast or cheaper alternative to punishment—it requires care and time |
| **Power Imbalances**  | Must account for identity-based or relational power differences                 |
| **Survivor Autonomy** | No one should be pressured to forgive or reconcile                              |
| **Lack of Resources** | Effective RJ depends on trained facilitators and community readiness            |

- What harm occurred—and what ripple effects did it create?
- What needs to be acknowledged, validated, or made visible?
- What actions can help restore trust or integrity?
- Who else (community, system) holds some responsibility for this harm?
