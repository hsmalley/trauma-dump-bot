# 🔐 Consensual Non-Consent (CNC)

**Consensual Non-Consent (CNC)**—sometimes called **rape play** or **forced play**—refers to **pre-negotiated scenarios that simulate a lack of consent**, while all actions remain rooted in **clear, affirmative, revocable consent**. It is a form of **edge play** that often engages themes of **powerlessness, violation, and psychological vulnerability**.

CNC is one of the **most high-risk forms of play** due to its proximity to trauma triggers and its potential for boundary confusion or misuse.

> “CNC is a container where ‘no’ may be part of the scene—but never outside its ethical frame.”

## 🧠 Key Concepts

| Concept                  | Description                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pre-negotiated Scene** | Everything is scripted or outlined in advance (limits, roles, actions). |
| **Safe Surrender**       | The submissive yields control while knowing safety is maintained.       |
| **Controlled Violation** | May involve resisting, struggling, or saying “no” as part of roleplay.  |
| **Aftercare Critical**   | Physical and psychological processing post-scene is essential.          |

## 🔐 Consent Infrastructure

- **Explicit Negotiation** – Use CNC negotiation templates, list hard and soft limits.
- **Safewords & Signals** – Use unambiguous, honored safewords; consider non-verbal backups.
- **Scene Containment** – Designated start and end points; avoid bleed into everyday roles.
- **Debriefing** – Discuss what felt empowering vs too much; repair if needed.
- **Written Consent** (optional) – Some use contracts or documented affirmations.

## ⚠️ Risk & Ethics

- **Real Trauma Triggers** – Simulated rape or violence can surface unprocessed trauma.
- **Social Risk** – Misunderstanding CNC can lead to shame, community stigma, or legal risk.
- **Power Misuse** – Predators may hide abuse under CNC language—**ongoing consent must be real**.
- **Emotional Fallout** – Even a “good” CNC scene can create confusion, shame, or identity tension afterward.

- What would “going too far” look like—and how do I want my partner to respond?
- How do I separate this roleplay from real-life violence or trauma?
- What parts of me feel activated or challenged by surrender in this way?
