# 🧠 Intersectional Psychology

**Intersectional Psychology** is a framework that explores how **multiple, overlapping identities** (e.g., race, gender, class, disability, sexuality, age, migration status) interact with **systems of power and oppression** to influence psychological well-being.

It challenges traditional psychology’s tendency to decontextualize suffering, offering a lens that is **identity-aware, power-conscious, and justice-oriented**.

> Coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw, _intersectionality_ describes how people experience layered systems of marginalization—not as additive identities, but as **interdependent experiences**.

## 🧩 Core Tenets

### 1. **Multiplicity of Identity**

- No identity is experienced in isolation.
- People are shaped by **intersections** of privilege and oppression.

### 2. **Systems Shape Symptoms**

- Emotions and behaviors arise in **response to social conditions**, not just internal pathology.
- Racism, transphobia, ableism, and poverty affect mental health and coping styles.

### 3. **Power and Access Matter**

- Healing depends on **material, cultural, and relational access**—not just willpower.
- Recognizes institutional betrayal, healthcare disparities, and cultural erasure.

### 4. **Centering the Margins**

- Uplifts knowledge and resilience from marginalized communities.
- Counters dominant narratives about wellness, normalcy, and pathology.

## 🧠 Trauma-Informed Applications

- Historical and generational trauma affect body, identity, and trust.
- **Code-switching, hypervigilance, or emotional suppression** may reflect adaptations to unsafe environments.
- Consent and repair must account for **power asymmetries** in relationships and systems.

## 🛠 Relational Tools

- **Contextual Validation**: “Of course this is hard—given what you’ve lived through.”
- **Power Mapping**: Identify where relational or systemic power is being exercised or erased.
- **Cultural Awareness**: Whose norms are being centered or imposed?

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- How do my intersecting identities shape what I need to feel safe?
- What survival strategies have I developed in response to my context?
- Where have I internalized dominant narratives about strength, emotion, or boundaries?
- What would care look like if it honored _all_ of me?
