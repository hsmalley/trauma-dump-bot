# 🪞 Gestalt Therapy

**Gestalt Therapy** is an experiential, humanistic therapy that emphasizes **awareness, embodiment, and present-moment experience**. It focuses less on diagnosing and more on **what’s happening now**, especially in the **relationship between therapist and client**.

> “Lose your mind and come to your senses.” – Fritz Perls
