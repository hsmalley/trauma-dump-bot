### üß© Definition and Core Themes

**Sensorimotor Psychotherapy (SP)** is a body-centered approach to trauma and attachment
therapy developed by Pat Ogden. It integrates neuroscience, cognitive therapy, and
principles of mindfulness with the core belief that **the body holds the unresolved
residue of traumatic and relational experience**. SP focuses on processing and
regulating the **sensorimotor** (sensation and movement) components of trauma memories,
which are often stored implicitly (non-verbally).

- **Core Goal:** To help clients develop a **mindful, conscious relationship with their
  body** and use the body's movements, posture, and physical sensations to process
  incomplete survival responses, integrate fragmented memories, and promote nervous
  system regulation.
- **Trauma as Incomplete Action:** Trauma is viewed as a **survival response that was
  blocked** or incomplete (e.g., the impulse to fight, flee, or push an aggressor away).
  This blocked energy remains trapped in the body's nervous system, driving current
  symptoms.
- **Implicit Memory:** SP focuses on working with **implicit memory**‚Äîthe non-verbal,
  emotional, and sensory memory that drives flashbacks, hyper-vigilance, and defensive
  postures‚Äîrather than just the explicit, narrative memory of the event.

### üåø The Three Phases

SP follows a structured, phased approach to ensure safety and effective processing:

1. **Phase 1: Stabilization and Resource Building:** Focuses on establishing safety,
   teaching **mindfulness** of body sensations, and installing internal and relational
   **resources** (e.g., grounding, soothing memories, stable posture) to increase the
   client's **Window of Tolerance** and prepare the nervous system for trauma work.
2. **Phase 2: Processing Traumatic Memory:** Uses the body's movements and posture to
   access and complete the frozen or incomplete survival actions (**"completion of
   action"**). The client is guided to briefly attend to the body's response, titrate
   the intensity, and practice an alternative, safe action in the present moment.
3. **Phase 3: Integration and Mastery:** Focuses on integrating the newly processed
   material into the client's narrative and internal working model, consolidating
   emotional regulation, and fostering a sense of **agency and mastery** over the body
   and self.

### üß† Nervous System and Embodiment

SP is deeply rooted in the principles of **Polyvagal Theory (PVT)** and somatic
awareness.

- **Tracking the Body (Neuroception):** The therapist helps the client notice the subtle
  shifts in their physical state (tension, heat, tingling, numbness) which are signals
  of their **Polyvagal State** (Sympathetic mobilization or Dorsal Vagal shutdown).
- **Body as Language:** Symptoms like chronic back pain, shallow breathing, or tension
  are seen as the body's attempt to "tell the story" of the trauma. The therapy works to
  translate this physical language into verbal, integrated understanding.
- **Working with Defenses:** Defense mechanisms (e.g., dissociation, emotional numbing)
  are often experienced physically. SP works to gently track and respect the **physical
  mobilization of defenses** before attempting to process the core trauma memory.

### üõ†Ô∏è Strategies, Prompts, and Practices

- **Micro-Skill (Somatic Tracing):** Guiding the client to notice a sensation associated
  with the trauma (e.g., tightness in the chest) and then asking them to describe the
  sensation without judgment, focusing only on its **qualities** (temperature, movement,
  texture).
- **Prompt (Testing the Impulse):** When a client reports an incomplete action (e.g., "I
  wanted to scream, but couldn't"), the therapist guides them to **gently, slowly
  rehearse the movement** in a safe, titrated way (e.g., a small physical push, a quiet
  sound of protest) to allow the nervous system to complete the survival response in the
  present.
- **Micro-Skill (Resource Activation):** Asking the client to recall a moment of
  **power, security, or calm** and then intentionally noticing the **physical
  sensations** associated with that resource (e.g., the feeling of warmth, the expansion
  of the chest) to anchor the body in a **Ventral Vagal** state.
