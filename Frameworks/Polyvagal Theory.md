# Polyvagal Theory

## Overview
Stephen Porgesâ€™ model describing how the autonomic nervous system shifts between states of safety, mobilization, and shutdown.

## Key Concepts
- Ventral Vagal (social engagement, safety)
- Sympathetic (fight/flight)
- Dorsal Vagal (shutdown, freeze)

## Application in Relational Analysis
- Spot nervous system cues in tone, pacing, and word choice.
- Identify co-regulation vs. misattunement.
