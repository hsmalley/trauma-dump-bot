### üß© Definition and Core Themes

**Solo Polyamory (Solo Poly)** is a form of **non-hierarchical** polyamory where an individual chooses to be their own **primary partner**. They may have multiple loving, committed relationships, but they **do not anchor their life** to any single partner or relationship structure. The solo poly individual prioritizes their **autonomy** and **self-sufficiency** above all else.

### üåø Key Distinctions

Solo Poly differs significantly from other forms of ethical non-monogamy (ENM) like traditional hierarchical polyamory or open relationships.

| Feature | Solo Poly | Hierarchical Polyamory |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Status** | The individual is their own primary. | Partners are ranked (Primary/Secondary). |
| **Commitment** | Relationships are commitment-rich, but **structure-light**. | Often includes joint finances, cohabitation, shared future plans. |
| **The "Veto"** | Explicitly rejects veto power from all partners. | A primary partner often holds veto power over a secondary connection. |
| **Living Situation** | Typically **lives alone**, with friends, or with a partner but without the relationship being treated as a domestic anchor. | Defines the relationship that shares domestic, financial, or parenting responsibilities. |

### üß† Psychological and Relational Lens

Solo Poly is an identity and practice rooted in radical self-autonomy and often high **differentiation**.

-   **Radical Autonomy:** The framework is chosen to eliminate the implicit pressures of **mononormativity** (the societal expectation of finding "The One") and **amatonormativity** (the belief that romantic/sexual relationships are inherently superior to friendship or family).
-   **Internal Security:** Solo Poly demands a high degree of **internal, self-secured attachment**. Security is derived from the individual's inner self-worth and ability to **self-soothe**, rather than from external validation, titles, or guarantees of longevity from a partner.
-   **Addressing Co-Dependence:** The structure is an effective way to actively challenge co-dependence, as the individual retains full ownership of their life path, finances, and emotional regulation.

### üõ†Ô∏è Strategies and Practices

The successful practice of Solo Poly relies on rigorous self-awareness and transparent boundary setting.

-   **Explicit Boundary Models:** It requires proactive communication to define what the relationship *will not* include (e.g., "I will not share a bank account," "I will not move in with you") to prevent partners from developing expectations of escalation toward a traditional "primary" status.
-   **Clear Contracting:** When beginning a relationship, the solo poly person must clearly state their **non-escalation policy**‚Äîthat the relationship, regardless of depth or length, will not replace their fundamental life structure.
-   **Managing Partner Expectations:** The largest relational challenge is managing partners who are accustomed to hierarchical structures and may view the solo poly person as "less committed" or fear the relationship will stall without traditional markers of progress.
