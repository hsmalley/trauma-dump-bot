# 🌀 Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

**Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** is a neurodevelopmental variation that shapes **social communication, sensory processing, emotional regulation, and cognitive style**. Rather than a deficit, autism can be understood as a distinct **neurological orientation**—often pathologized under normative frameworks but rich in depth, sensitivity, and pattern recognition.

> “Autism is not a puzzle to be solved—it’s a perspective to be honored.”

## 🧠 Core Traits (Contextual, Not Universal)

| Area                                | Common Expressions                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Communication**                   | Direct or idiosyncratic language, scripting, echolalia, or selective mutism            |
| **Social Interaction**              | Preference for depth over small talk; different norms for reciprocity or eye contact   |
| **Sensory Experience**              | Hyper- or hypo-sensitivity to light, sound, touch, taste, or movement                  |
| **Cognitive Patterns**              | Detail-focused processing, nonlinear or associative logic, strong memory for specifics |
| **Repetitive/Regulatory Behaviors** | Stimming, routines, special interests as self-regulation or joy                        |
| **Emotional Regulation**            | Shutdowns, meltdowns, or alexithymia under stress or misattunement                     |

## 🧩 Key Concepts

- **Masking** – Suppressing autistic traits to pass as neurotypical; often linked to exhaustion and identity loss
- **Double Empathy Problem** – Communication breakdowns are mutual misunderstandings, not a one-sided deficit
- **Monotropism** – Focused attention on a few intense interests, leading to deep flow and difficulty shifting
- **Autistic Burnout** – Cumulative stress collapse from sustained masking or sensory/emotional overload

---

## 💥 Lived Impacts

- Often **diagnosed late** or misdiagnosed—especially in AFAB, BIPOC, or queer individuals
- Social trauma from **repeated misattunement**, rejection, or forced conformity
- Relational conflict over **differing needs for space, structure, or directness**
- Systemic harm from **compliance-based “interventions”** rather than support
- Grief over lost authenticity, or relationships that demand constant self-erasure

## 💡 Strengths (When Supported)

- Pattern recognition, innovation, systems thinking
- Integrity, deep curiosity, intense focus
- Emotional honesty and loyalty
- Unique humor, aesthetics, and creativity
- Passionate advocacy for justice and truth
- Sensory joy and attunement to subtleties

---

## 🛠 Supportive Practices

- **De-Masking Permission** – Spaces where stim, silence, or clarity are welcomed
- **Sensory Customization** – Access to preferred textures, noise levels, lighting
- **Flexible Communication Tools** – Scripts, writing, AAC, or visual supports
- **Consent-Based Routine** – Predictable rhythms that honor agency, not control
- **Autistic-Led Validation** – Community and frameworks built by autistic people
- **Mutual Translation Practices** – Supporting neurotype difference without pathologizing

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- Where do I feel safest showing up as I am?
- What parts of me have been labeled “too much” or “too little”?
- Which needs have I been taught to ignore to be acceptable?
- What brings me genuine regulation, delight, and clarity?
