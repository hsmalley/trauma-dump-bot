# 🕸️ Total Power Exchange (TPE)

**Total Power Exchange (TPE)**—also called **24/7 D/s** or **Total Authority Transfer**—is a consensual dynamic where one person (the **dominant**) holds ongoing authority over another (the **submissive**) across multiple or all areas of life.

TPE is not a literal loss of autonomy but a **highly structured, negotiated relationship dynamic** where roles are sustained beyond isolated scenes, often extending into domestic, sexual, emotional, and social spheres.

> TPE is a form of **identity-based kink** and **relational design**, requiring deep trust, communication, and ethical containment.

## 🧠 Key Elements

| Element            | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope of Power** | May include behavior, dress, schedule, speech, sexual access, rituals, etc. |
| **Duration**       | Often full-time or indefinite; may have check-ins or contract terms.        |
| **Consent**        | Ongoing, informed, enthusiastic, and _revocable at any time_.               |
| **Responsibility** | Dominants are expected to act with care, attunement, and ethical rigor.     |

## 🛠 Structures & Tools

- **Contracts** (symbolic or detailed)
- **Protocols** (daily rituals, speech codes, posture rules)
- **Collars** (symbolic of belonging, structure, or commitment)
- **Check-ins** (emotional, logistical, and consent affirmations)
- **Behavior tracking** or tasks as part of structure

---

## ⚠️ Cautions & Ethics

- **Consent ≠ blanket waiver**: Consent must remain **informed, specific, and reversible**.
- **Abuse risks** are higher without clear boundaries, community accountability, and emotional literacy.
- **Isolation dynamics** (e.g., control over communication or finances) require added scrutiny and safeguards.
- Submissives should maintain **exit plans** and **support networks**.

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- What draws me to power exchange—structure, surrender, service, control?
- How do I differentiate **control** from **coercion** in myself and others?
- What parts of me thrive under protocols—and what parts resist or hide?
- If I were to renegotiate or exit this dynamic, how would I know I’m safe and supported?
