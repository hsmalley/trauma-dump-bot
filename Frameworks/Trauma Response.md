# Trauma Response — Framework Notes

> Action-oriented, trauma-informed guidance for first contact, short-term stabilization,
> and coordinated follow-up after traumatic exposure — suitable for single-incident
> response, organizational incidents, and mass trauma settings.

---

## Purpose

- Provide a concise operational rubric for frontline responders and care teams to assess
  immediate needs, reduce harm, preserve safety, and plan short- and medium-term
  supports after trauma exposure.
- Promote consistent documentation, ethical practice, cultural humility, and staff
  support across settings.

---

## Scope & Audience

- Designed for first-contact contexts (scene, ED, workplace, school), early psychosocial
  interventions, and handoff to ongoing mental-health or social services.
- Works across ages and diverse populations; adapt language, pacing, and interventions
  to developmental stage, culture, and cognitive capacity.

## Safety-First Immediate Checklist (first 0–10 minutes)

1. **Is anyone in immediate physical danger?** Prioritize physical safety (evacuate,
   stabilize injuries, call medical backup).
2. **Life-threat indicators:** uncontrolled bleeding, airway compromise, severe head
   injury, inability to follow commands → immediate medical activation.
3. **Assess acute risk:** direct questions about imminent self-harm, homicidal intent,
   or ongoing threat; if positive, implement emergency containment and
   involuntary-protective measures per law.
4. **Secure the environment:** prevent secondary exposures, minimize media/photography
   intrusion, and protect privacy.
5. **Triage psychosocial needs:** who needs immediate calming, who is safe to remain
   with supports, who needs medical attention, who needs psychological first aid
   (PFA)/brief stabilization.
6. **Document initial actions and identify contacts** (patient, family, employer,
   incident commander) for handoff.

---

## Core Domains for Structured Assessment (brief frontline domains)

- **Exposure & mechanism:** what happened, direct vs. witnessed exposure, duration,
  perceived life-threat.
- **Peritraumatic response:** dissociation, choking sensation, uncontrollable trembling,
  loss of consciousness, intense fear—note these verbatim.
- **Medical status:** injuries, pain, vital signs, hypoxia, head injury signs, substance
  intoxication/withdrawal.
- **Safety & risk:** active threats, unsafe environment, suicidal/homicidal ideation,
  self-harm behaviors.
- **Capacity & cognition:** orientation, ability to consent, severe disorganization or
  confusion (may indicate organic/medical cause).
- **Social support & immediate resources:** presence of trusted person, phone access,
  shelter, food, medications, identification.
- **Cultural/identity considerations:** language needs, gender identity, religious or
  cultural safety requirements, previous trauma history that may be reactivated.

---

## Rapid Triage / Risk Stratification (practical disposition)

- **Immediate medical emergency:** unstable vitals, major trauma, neurological
  compromise, severe substance/withdrawal risk → urgent medical admission.
- **High psychosocial risk:** active suicidal/homicidal intent, severe dissociation,
  psychosis, or inability to care for self → psychiatric assessment/admission.
- **Moderate need:** intense distress, sleep impairment, functional impairment, limited
  supports → brief stabilization + expedited outpatient/trauma-informed follow-up within
  3–7 days.
- **Low immediate need:** manageable distress, adequate supports, no safety concerns →
  PFA, psychoeducation, self-help resources, schedule routine follow-up.

---

## Immediate Interventions & Response Actions (0–72 hours)

- **Psychological First Aid (PFA) core actions:** ensure safety and comfort; identify
  basic needs; provide practical assistance; listen without forcing disclosure; connect
  to supports and information; and link to services. Keep interventions brief,
  practical, and non-pathologizing.
- **Grounding & stabilization techniques:** orient to present (time/place), breathing
  regulation (box/paced breathing), sensory anchoring (5-4-3-2-1), and short behavioral
  grounding. Use brief coaching rather than long debriefing.
- **Avoid presumptive probing of trauma narrative** unless the person requests or it is
  clinically necessary; intrusive recollection can retraumatize in the immediate
  aftermath.
- **Address acute medical/medication needs:** analgesia, tetanus prophylaxis, prevention
  of hypothermia, and medications for severe agitation or insomnia only when clinically
  indicated.
- **Triage to specialty services:** arrange medical, psychiatric, social-work, legal, or
  shelter referrals as indicated. Provide clear next-step appointments and contact
  names.
- **Practical support:** help with communications (call family, employer), childcare
  arrangements, temporary ID, and access to essentials (food, water, clothing).
- **Means safety:** if self-harm risk exists, negotiate immediate means restriction with
  the person and supports.
- **Documentation:** time-stamp observations, verbatim distress statements, capacity
  assessments, consents/refusals, and referrals made.

---

## Short-Term Follow-up & Care Coordination (3 days — 8 weeks)

- **Early outreach:** structured check-in (phone or in-person) within 48–72 hours for
  moderate/high-contact cases; document attempts and outcomes.
- **Stepped care planning:** determine pathway—watchful waiting + PFA, trauma-focused
  therapy referral, psychiatric evaluation, or social-safety interventions.
- **Screening for evolving psychopathology:** use validated brief instruments at 2–6
  weeks to identify PTSD, depression, prolonged grief, or complicated adjustment
  reactions.
- **Referral priorities:** prioritize trauma-informed therapists for people with
  significant impairment, refer to specialist services for children, survivors of sexual
  violence, or complex comorbidity.
- **Interdisciplinary handoff:** transmit concise summary (exposure, initial risk,
  interventions given, immediate supports, follow-up plan) to receiving clinicians with
  consent.
- **Legal/forensic needs:** offer forensic-exam referrals, documentation for legal
  processes, and chain-of-custody guidance where relevant.

---

## Longer-Term Interventions (beyond 8 weeks)

- **Trauma-focused psychotherapy:** for persistent PTSD/complex presentations, consider
  evidence-based therapies (trauma-focused CBT, CPT, PE, EMDR) delivered by trained
  clinicians.
- **Comorbidity treatment:** integrate treatment for depression, substance use, chronic
  pain, sleep disorders, and relationship dysfunction.
- **Rehabilitation & community re-integration:** occupational therapy, return-to-work
  plans, school re-entry supports, and peer support groups.
- **Cultural and community healing approaches:** partner with community leaders,
  faith-based supports, and culturally congruent practices when appropriate and desired
  by the person.

---

## Communication & Trauma-Informed Interaction Tips

- **Use plain, respectful language**; validate distress: “You survived something
  terrifying — your reactions are common.”
- **Ask permission** before touching, taking photos, or asking sensitive questions.
- **Limit repetitive questioning**; coordinate information collection to minimize
  retraumatizing repetition.
- **Be identity-affirming and culturally humble**; provide interpreters and
  gender-affirming options as needed.
- **Avoid mini-debriefing** (compulsory recounting of the event) in acute phase; focus
  on containment, safety, and practical needs.

---

## Documentation Template (minimum fields)

- Date/time, responder/clinician name and role, location of contact.
- Incident summary (brief), patient statement (verbatim when possible).
- Vital signs and medical triage findings.
- Mental-status and capacity notes (orientation, dissociation, suicidal ideation).
- Immediate safety actions taken and by whom.
- Referrals made, contact details, and follow-up appointment date/time.
- Consent, confidentiality limits, and any notifications to family/authorities
  (timestamped).
- Photos/forensic evidence documented per protocol (if applicable).

---

## Staffing, Supervisor & Staff Support (post-incident)

- **Briefing & debriefing:** operational debrief for logistics; optional psychological
  debrief for staff should be voluntary, confidential, and focused on coping/resources
  rather than forced disclosure.
- **Peer support & supervision:** activate peer-support networks and clinical
  supervision for responders exposed to distressing scenes.
- **Rotation & rest:** limit consecutive exposure to traumatic scenes; enforce rest and
  shift rotations to reduce cumulative stress.
- **Monitoring for secondary trauma:** provide access to counseling and early
  intervention for responders showing persistent distress or functional decline.

---

## Postvention (if death or suicide occurs)

- **Immediate family support:** proactive outreach, practical assistance, and linkage to
  bereavement resources.
- **Care with language:** avoid sensationalizing details; preserve privacy and dignity
  in communication.
- **Organizational response:** activate postvention protocols, memorial/practical
  decision-making with family input, and communication plan for staff/clients.
- **Community risk reduction:** if suicide contagion risk exists (cluster potential),
  coordinate public messaging with health authorities emphasizing help-seeking and
  resources.

---

## Ethical & Legal Considerations

- **Confidentiality limits:** explain duty to report imminent danger, child protection,
  or threats to others. Document consent and disclosure decisions.
- **Forensic integrity:** follow chain-of-custody rules for evidence, and use trained
  examiners for forensic assessments.
- **Mandatory reporting:** know local statutes for child abuse, elder abuse, or other
  mandated reporting—act without delay when required.
- **Cultural/legal sensitivity:** respect cultural norms while following legal
  obligations; consult legal or cultural advisors when conflicts arise.
