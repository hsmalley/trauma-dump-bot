# 🎭 Drama Triangle & Empowerment Triangle

The **Drama Triangle** (Stephen Karpman) describes common reactive roles in relational conflict. The **Empowerment Triangle** (David Emerald) reframes those roles into conscious, creative alternatives rooted in agency and boundaries.

These models help identify **cyclical power struggles**, **unmet needs**, and paths to **relational repair**.

---

## 🔺 The Drama Triangle

Three reactive roles that maintain conflict and dependency:

### 1. **Victim**

- Feels helpless, overwhelmed, stuck.
- Seeks rescue or validation.
- Belief: “I can’t do this.”

### 2. **Rescuer**

- Fixes, helps, or overfunctions without consent.
- Avoids their own discomfort by overfocusing on others.
- Belief: “I must save them.”

### 3. **Persecutor**

- Blames, controls, criticizes.
- Uses power or authority to restore order.
- Belief: “It’s your fault.”

> ⚠️ People often switch roles rapidly—e.g., a rescuer becomes a persecutor when overwhelmed.

## 🔺 The Empowerment Triangle

Three conscious roles that promote growth, autonomy, and collaboration:

### 1. **Creator (vs. Victim)**

- Owns choices, seeks possibility.
- Asks: “What do I want? What can I do next?”

### 2. **Coach (vs. Rescuer)**

- Offers support and reflection without taking over.
- Asks: “What do you need? How can I support your process?”

### 3. **Challenger (vs. Persecutor)**

- Sets boundaries and invites growth with respect.
- Says: “I see your capacity—I’m naming the impact.”

## 🔄 Role Shifts in Practice

| Drama Role | Empowered Shift | Micro-Move Example                        |
| ---------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Victim     | Creator         | “What’s one thing I can influence?”       |
| Rescuer    | Coach           | “Do you want help or just to be heard?”   |
| Persecutor | Challenger      | “I care enough to tell the truth kindly.” |

## 🧠 Trauma & Nervous System Lens

- **Fawn responses** often activate Rescuer/Victim patterns.
- **Fight responses** can escalate into Persecutor behaviors.
- Empowered roles require **regulation, boundary clarity, and differentiation**.

---

## 🛠 Relational Practices

- Use parts language: “A part of me wants to fix this—what does your part need?”
- Pause role-switching cycles: “I feel like I’m rescuing—can we reset?”
- Clarify consent: “Would support feel helpful, or do you just need space?”
- Use boundary scripts from [[Boundary Models]] to shift from reactivity to respect.

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- When do I feel pulled into these roles (Victim, Rescuer, Persecutor)?
- What role am I _most comfortable_ or familiar with?
- How does it feel to shift from control to curiosity or support?
- What’s a small action I could take as a Creator right now?
