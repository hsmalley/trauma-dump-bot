### üß© Definition and Core Themes

**Disability Justice (DJ)** is a political and relational framework, pioneered by
disabled queer and trans Black, Indigenous, and people of color (QTBIPOC) activists. It
critiques the traditional, often white and middle-class-centric **Disability Rights
Movement (DRM)** for focusing too narrowly on policy and assimilation (like the ADA). DJ
explicitly centers **intersectionality** and views disability as an issue inseparable
from race, class, gender, and colonialism.

- **Core Goal:** To dismantle ableism and all interlocking systems of oppression by
  asserting the **inherent worth and necessity** of all bodies and minds. The goal is
  collective liberation and interdependence, not just individual accessibility.
- **The Ten Principles (Sins Invalid):** Key tenets include **Interdependence** (a
  recognition that no one is truly independent), **Wholeness** (valuing the entire
  being, including illness and trauma), and **Collective Access** (prioritizing
  universal design and communal care over individual accommodation).
- **Key Shift:** Moving from a **rights-based, compliance model** to a **justice-based,
  systemic transformation model**.

---

### üåø Traits and Lived Experience

DJ reframes disability from an individual tragedy to a predictable result of systemic
failure, fostering collective power.

- **Lived Experience (Empowerment):** Disability is understood as a natural form of
  human variation that is **made disabling** by inaccessible environments and oppressive
  social structures (the **Social Model of Disability**). This reframing removes
  personal shame and fosters a collective sense of political action.
- **Valuing Interdependence:** The rejection of hyper-individualism is key. DJ
  normalizes and celebrates the reality that **all people need support** and that
  providing care is a shared, ethical responsibility, not a burden or a charity.
- **Access as Love:** Access (e.g., ramps, captions, flexible scheduling,
  trauma-informed care) is not seen as a regulatory obligation but as a fundamental,
  creative expression of **care, respect, and relational commitment**.

---

### üß† Nervous System and Parts Work Lens

Disability Justice creates a radically safe environment by honoring bodily limits and
systemic trauma.

- **Honoring the Body's Limits (PVT):** DJ principles directly counter the **Drive
  System** (capitalistic pressure for constant productivity) and the **Threat System**
  (fear of not meeting societal standards). By demanding **collective access and rest**,
  DJ intentionally provides the conditions necessary for **Ventral Vagal (Safe and
  Social)** regulation.
- **Internalized Ableism (IFS):** The framework directly addresses **Internalized
  Ableism**‚Äîthe self-criticism or shame that stems from not being productive or capable
  in a capitalist sense. This shame is the voice of a **Protective Manager Part** trying
  to enforce oppressive, ableist norms. DJ seeks to unburden this Part by validating the
  reality of difference.
- **Trauma-Informed Access:** Recognizing that disabled people (especially QTBIPOC) have
  disproportionately experienced systemic violence, DJ ensures that all relational,
  organizational, and physical spaces are fundamentally **trauma-informed** and built on
  consent.

### üíû Attachment and Relational Patterns

DJ challenges conventional, often ablest, notions of relational commitment and
reciprocity.

- **Shifting Reciprocity:** It moves away from rigid, equal (50/50) models of
  reciprocity toward **cyclical, flexible, and responsive models**. Reciprocity is
  defined by mutual care over time, not equal output in a single moment, fostering a
  more sustainable form of **Secure Attachment**.
- **Relational Access Needs:** DJ requires partners/systems to explicitly ask about and
  accommodate relational access needs (e.g., "I need communication in writing," "I need
  a 48-hour buffer before social events," or "I need to lie down during difficult
  conversations"). This creates **clear, healthy boundaries** that are flexible to
  bodily and mental variation.
- **Challenging the "Ideal" Partner:** It dismantles the ablest idea that a partner
  should be a fully self-sufficient individual who requires no "effort." DJ normalizes
  the reality of human need and caregiving within intimacy.

| **Paternalism:** Partners without disabilities may fall into patterns of **paternalism** (doing things _for_ a disabled partner rather than collaboratively _with_ them), which undermines the other's agency. | **Radical Empathy:** Cultivating the ability to anticipate and flexibly meet non-obvious needs builds deep reserves of **radical empathy** and relational competence.           |
| **Burnout from Care:** The primary caregiver in a dyad can experience severe burnout if the wider system/community fails to practice interdependence and share the labor of care.                              | **Creative Problem Solving:** DJ requires constant innovation to create access solutions, fostering a high degree of **creative problem-solving** in relationships and systems. |

### üõ†Ô∏è Strategies, Prompts, and Practices

- **Micro-Skill (The Access Rider):** Encourage individuals to create a personal
  **Access Rider**‚Äîa document detailing their specific needs for accessibility, energy
  level, communication style, and trauma triggers‚Äîto proactively communicate their needs
  to partners or groups.
- **Prompt (Interdependence Check):** Ask the client/partner: _"What is one thing you
  can ask for help with this week, and what is one small thing you can offer to someone
  else, regardless of perceived ability?"_
- **Micro-Skill (Slow Down):** Prioritize the **Principle of Tempo/Pace**. Explicitly
  ask: _"Is this pace of conversation/activity working for your body and mind right now?
  Can we slow down?"_
