# ♿ Disability Justice

**Disability Justice (DJ)** is an intersectional movement and healing framework created by disabled Black, brown, queer, and trans activists. It expands beyond the medical model and even the rights-based disability model to center **access, interdependence, and collective liberation**.

Coined and shaped by groups like _Sins Invalid_, Disability Justice asserts that **ableism is deeply entangled with colonialism, white supremacy, capitalism, and patriarchy**, and must be addressed at every level—personal, relational, systemic, and somatic.

> “No body or mind can be left behind.”

## 🧠 Core Principles (adapted from Sins Invalid)

| Principle                           | Description                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Intersectionality**               | Disability does not exist in a vacuum—race, gender, class, and queerness matter |
| **Leadership of the Most Impacted** | Those most affected lead the vision                                             |
| **Anti-Capitalism**                 | Bodies are not machines for production; value ≠ output                          |
| **Cross-Movement Solidarity**       | Disability Justice is inseparable from racial, gender, and labor justice        |
| **Wholeness**                       | Every part of us—messy, nonlinear, traumatized—is valid                         |
| **Interdependence**                 | We move together, not alone; care webs are strength, not burden                 |
| **Collective Access & Liberation**  | Access is not compliance—it’s love, design, and culture                         |

## ⚠️ Challenges to Watch

| Challenge                      | Risk                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Performative Accessibility** | Token gestures without culture change                            |
| **Ableism in Healing Spaces**  | “Just move your body” / “You create your own reality” narratives |
| **Inspiration Porn**           | Romanticizing disabled survival while ignoring systemic violence |
| **Caregiver Control**          | Support that overrides autonomy, infantilizes, or coerces        |

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- Who is missing from the spaces I call “inclusive”?
- How do I define “capacity”—and who taught me that?
- What does access mean in _my_ body, community, or culture?
- Where have I internalized ableism toward myself or others?
