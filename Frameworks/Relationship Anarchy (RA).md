# 🖤 Relationship Anarchy (RA)

**Relationship Anarchy (RA)** is a relationship philosophy that **rejects hierarchy, ownership, and normative expectations** in favor of **freely chosen, self-defined, and mutually respectful connections**. It challenges the cultural script that prioritizes romantic/sexual bonds above all others and emphasizes **relational freedom, equity, and intentionality**.

RA is not just a style of non-monogamy—it’s a broader **political and ethical stance** on how we relate across all domains (friends, lovers, kin, collaborators).

## 🧠 Core Principles

### 1. **Autonomy & Consent**

- Each relationship is freely entered, co-created, and changeable.
- People are not obligations or resources to be managed.

### 2. **No Prescribed Hierarchies**

- Romantic love is not "more real" than friendship, queerplatonic bonds, or community ties.
- RA resists default prioritization (e.g., nesting > casual > friends).

### 3. **Design Your Own Relationships**

- No “shoulds”—just mutual, evolving agreements.
- Allows for fluidity, self-definition, and context-specific bonds.

### 4. **Abundance, Not Scarcity**

- Trust that love, care, and attention are not finite.
- Comparison and jealousy are approached with curiosity, not control.

## 🔄 RA Practices

- **Anarchy in practice**: No default scripts—relationships evolve by consent, not expectation.
- **Regular check-ins**: "What are we building together? Is it still working for us?"
- **Boundary mapping**: Co-create agreements based on shared needs, not assumed norms.
- **Decentering romance**: Value all forms of intimacy, including platonic and chosen family.

## 🛠 Tools & Prompts

- “What would this relationship look like if we designed it from scratch?”
- “What do I genuinely want to offer and receive here?”
- “How do we care for each other without obligation?”
- “What kinds of commitment feel good to us—not inherited from culture?”

## ⚠️ Common Tensions

- **Misunderstood as anti-commitment**: RA is not avoidance—it’s self-authorship.
- **No roadmap**: Requires high self-awareness and communication, especially during rupture.
- **Social friction**: RA often clashes with mononormative or capitalist values.

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- Where am I reproducing hierarchy out of habit?
- What would freedom look like in my relationships?
- How do I differentiate between _desire_ and _duty_?
- Can I hold care without control?
