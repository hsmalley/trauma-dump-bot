## Overview  
Nonviolent Communication (NVC), developed by Marshall Rosenberg, is a communication framework emphasizing empathy, honest expression, and needs-awareness to foster connection and collaboration.

## Core Concepts  

### Four Components of NVC  
1. Observation (without evaluation)  
2. Feelings  
3. Needs  
4. Request  

### Empathy & Self‑empathy  
- Empathy: presence and reflection  
- Self‑empathy: internal clarity before dialogue

### Needs vs Strategies  
Focus on shared needs rather than specific strategies.

### Requests vs Demands  
True requests invite freedom to say no.

## Applications  
- Conflict resolution  
- Couples / relational repair  
- Parenting / education  
- Organizational dialogue  
- Inner work / journaling  

## Best Practices & Considerations  
- Start with self‑empathy  
- Avoid evaluative language  
- Clarify specific, doable requests  
- Recognize threat states may block access to NVC

## Example Prompts or Practices

- Separate inner critics from needs
