# 💬 Nonviolent Communication (NVC)

**Nonviolent Communication (NVC)** is a relational and emotional literacy framework developed by Marshall Rosenberg. It provides a four-part model for identifying needs, expressing feelings, and making requests **without blame, demand, or defensiveness**.

NVC is grounded in the belief that all behavior stems from attempts to meet needs—and that conflict arises when strategies clash, not because needs themselves are in conflict.

## 🧠 Core Principles

### 1. **All Humans Share Universal Needs**

- Needs include belonging, autonomy, safety, respect, rest, meaning, connection, and more.
- Strategies for meeting needs may be healthy or harmful—but the underlying needs are never wrong.

### 2. **Feelings Signal Needs**

- Emotions are **messengers**, not problems.
- They arise when needs are met (joy, peace) or unmet (sadness, frustration).

### 3. **Empathy and Honesty**

- NVC balances _self-expression (honesty)_ and _attuned listening (empathy)_.
- Connection > coercion.

## 🔄 The Four-Part NVC Model

1. **Observation**
   - "When I see/hear..."
   - _Just the facts_—no judgments or assumptions.

2. **Feeling**
   - "I feel..."
   - Use emotion words, not thoughts (“I feel abandoned” = thought).

3. **Need**
   - "...because I need/value..."
   - Names the unmet or met universal need.

4. **Request**
   - "Would you be willing to...?"
   - Clear, doable, and based on consent—not demand.

## 🛠 Sample NVC Sentence

> “When I heard you cancel, I felt disappointed, because I value consistency. Would you be willing to let me know earlier next time?”

## 🧠 Trauma & Conflict Adaptations

- **Modify for safety**: In high-conflict or trauma contexts, it’s okay to lead with empathy or modify structure.
- **Blend with parts work**: “A part of me feels angry because it needs clarity” (see [[IFS]]).
- **Consent-aware use**: Not everyone has equal voice or safety to use this model in power-imbalanced dynamics.

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- What feelings am I experiencing—and what might they be pointing to?
- Is this a request or a demand? Can the other person say no safely?
- Am I hearing needs behind the other person’s words—or reacting to tone?
- What need might _their_ strategy be trying to meet?

## 🔄 Integration with Other Frameworks

- Complements [[Gottman Method]] repair tools and bid recognition.
- Works well with [[DBT]] for emotion-regulation language.
- Pairs with [[Consent Culture]] for boundaries and clarity.
- Can be integrated with [[Narrative Therapy]] to deconstruct internalized blame.
