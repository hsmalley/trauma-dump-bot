# ⚡ Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)

**Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)** is a neurodevelopmental condition affecting **attention regulation, impulsivity, executive functioning, emotional modulation, and time awareness**. From a **neurodivergent-affirming and trauma-informed lens**, ADHD is not a deficit of character or willpower—it is a mismatch between a person’s nervous system and systemic expectations, often worsened by shame, masking, or structural inaccessibility.

## 🧠 Core Characteristics (context-sensitive)

| Domain                   | Common Experiences                                                                |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Attention**            | Distractibility, hyperfocus, inconsistent focus tied to interest or novelty       |
| **Impulsivity**          | Speaking or acting without pause, risk-taking, emotional immediacy                |
| **Emotional Regulation** | Rejection sensitivity, intense emotional swings, difficulty de-escalating         |
| **Time Perception**      | Time blindness, poor sense of duration or deadlines, urgency-driven tasks         |
| **Executive Function**   | Trouble with planning, prioritization, memory, transitions, and task-switching    |
| **Motivation**           | Interest-based nervous system, difficulty initiating unless emotionally activated |

## 🧩 Lived Realities

- **High internal shame** from constant feedback that one is “too much” or “not enough”
- **Uneven energy and capacity**, often fluctuating with nervous system states
- **Masked needs**, especially in marginalized ND individuals (e.g. AFAB, BIPOC, queer)
- **Hypercompetence → burnout → crash cycles**
- **Difficulty in relational repair** when inconsistency is perceived as lack of care

## 🌈 Strengths (with the right scaffolding)

- Creative, nonlinear problem solving
- Quick thinking and adaptability in crisis
- Emotional depth and authenticity
- Passion-fueled hyperfocus on areas of interest
- Humor, spontaneity, and innovation
- Pattern recognition across complex systems

---

## 🛠 Supportive Strategies

- **Body Doubling** – Regulated presence supports initiation and follow-through
- **Externalized Structures** – Visual reminders, trackers, rituals, and whiteboards
- **Sensory Supports** – Fidgets, weighted items, movement breaks, texture preferences
- **Containment Rituals** – Transition cues, energy tracking, task batching
- **Mutual Capacity Check-ins** – Scaffolded planning and relationship transparency
- **Permission-Based Pacing** – Reducing shame around rest, delay, or overwhelm

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- Where do I confuse “ability to perform” with “worthiness”?
- What helps me feel safe enough to start, continue, or stop?
- Which relationships support my rhythm—and which ones press me to mask?
- What kinds of accountability feel empowering vs. coercive?
