### üß© Definition and Core Themes

**Somatic Experiencing (SE)**, developed by biophysicist and psychologist Dr. Peter A. Levine, is a body-oriented therapeutic approach designed to heal **trauma and other stress-related disorders**. SE is based on the observation that animals in the wild rarely become traumatized when threatened because they naturally complete the full cycle of **survival responses** (fight or flight) through physical action, often through ritualized shaking or movements after the danger has passed. Trauma in humans is seen as the result of these high-intensity survival energies becoming **"stuck"** or frozen in the nervous system.

-   **Core Goal:** To help the client **discharge the frozen survival energy** trapped in the body and complete the self-protective movements that were interrupted during the traumatic event, thus allowing the nervous system to return to a state of equilibrium and self-regulation.
-   **Trauma as Physiological:** SE views trauma not as a psychological wound or a memory, but as a **physiological fact**‚Äîa highly activated nervous system that remains stuck in a defensive, non-resolved state (e.g., perpetual fight, flight, or freeze).
-   **The Felt Sense:** The primary tool is the **"felt sense"**‚Äîa client's mindful awareness of subtle physical sensations (tension, heat, tingling, vibration) that arise from the body in the present moment.

### üåø Key Therapeutic Techniques

SE employs specific techniques to gently unlock the frozen energy without overwhelming the client.

#### 1. Titration
Titration is the most fundamental technique. It involves working with the traumatic material in **very small, manageable doses**, like adding a few drops of concentrated medicine to water. The client is guided to briefly touch on a difficult sensation, then immediately return to a **resource** or a neutral feeling in the body. This prevents re-traumatization and builds the client's capacity for tolerance.

#### 2. Pendulation
Pendulation is the rhythmic movement of the client's attention between the uncomfortable, trauma-related sensations (**activation**) and the comfortable, resourced, or neutral sensations (**de-activation**). This process teaches the nervous system that it can experience activation and return to calm, increasing the **Window of Tolerance**.

#### 3. Tracking and Completion
The therapist helps the client **track** their implicit, non-verbal survival impulses (e.g., a hand slightly raising as if to push, a subtle shift in the foot as if to run). The therapist then guides the client to **slowly and mindfully complete that action** in the safety of the present moment, allowing the nervous system to process and discharge the previously frozen energy.

### üß† Nervous System and Trauma Lens

SE is highly effective because it directly addresses the brainstem and autonomic nervous system.

-   **Discharge of Energy:** When the survival impulse is completed (e.g., the client fully and safely pushes an imagined aggressor away), the body often experiences an involuntary **discharge** of energy, which may manifest as shaking, deep breaths, heat, or deep relaxation. This discharge signifies the system shifting out of the chronic defensive state.
-   **The Freeze Response:** SE offers a clear method for resolving the **Dorsal Vagal Freeze/Collapse** response (**Trauma Response**) by helping the client differentiate the physical sensations of the freeze (immobility, numbness) and then slowly introduce mobilization (small movements, wiggling fingers) to restore a feeling of agency.
-   **Bottom-Up Processing:** SE is a **bottom-up** approach, meaning it addresses the physiological and sensory components of trauma first, which reside in the lower, non-verbal parts of the brain (limbic system, brainstem). This processing must occur before cognitive (top-down) narrative work can be effective.
