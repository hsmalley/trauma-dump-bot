# Karpman Drama Triangle

## Overview
Describes dysfunctional conflict roles: Victim, Persecutor, Rescuer; interactions rotate roles and sustain drama.

## Core Principles
- Roles are states, not identities; they shift rapidly  
- Drama thrives on blame, secrecy, and lack of clear requests  
- Role exits require boundaries and ownership  

## Application
- Spot role invitations; decline and name needs instead  
- Shift to Empowerment Triangle (Creator–Coach–Challenger)  
- Replace blame with clear requests and agreements
