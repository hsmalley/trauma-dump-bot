# 🎭 Karpman Drama Triangle

The **Karpman Drama Triangle**, developed by Stephen Karpman, is a social interaction model that maps **three reactive roles** people often assume in conflict or distress: **Victim**, **Rescuer**, and **Persecutor**.

These roles maintain cycles of blame, control, and emotional enmeshment—and can **rapidly shift** within a single interaction.

> Often, these roles emerge unconsciously from early attachment patterns, trauma responses, or internalized scripts about safety, care, and power.

## 🔺 The Three Roles

### 1. **Victim**

- Belief: “I’m helpless / powerless / being harmed.”
- Seeks rescue or validation but feels incapable.
- May externalize blame or withdraw entirely.

### 2. **Rescuer**

- Belief: “You can’t do this—let me help (even without asking).”
- Overfunctions, fixes, or sacrifices self to feel needed.
- Avoids their own pain by focusing on others.

### 3. **Persecutor**

- Belief: “You’re wrong / bad / failing.”
- Controls or criticizes to regain power or safety.
- Often has a reactive protector role.

## 🔄 Role Fluidity

- People frequently **switch roles** mid-conflict:
  - A Rescuer feels unappreciated → becomes a Victim or Persecutor.
  - A Victim lashes out → becomes a Persecutor.
- These shifts create **recursive loops** of misunderstanding and disconnection.

---

## 🧠 Trauma & Nervous System Lens

- Rescuer often maps to **fawn**.
- Persecutor often maps to **fight**.
- Victim often maps to **freeze** or **shutdown**.
- All roles may reflect **protector parts** (see [[IFS]]), trying to manage threat.

## 🛠 Breaking the Drama Triangle

To exit the cycle, shift to conscious, empowered roles (see [[Empowerment Triangle]]):

| Drama Role | Empowered Shift | Practice Move                                 |
| ---------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Victim     | Creator         | Ask: “What do I want or need?”                |
| Rescuer    | Coach           | Ask: “Do you want support—or just space?”     |
| Persecutor | Challenger      | Say: “Here’s my boundary and why it matters.” |

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- Which role feels most familiar or tempting to me in conflict?
- How do I behave when I feel powerless or unheard?
- What does it feel like to offer care _with_ consent—not as rescue?
- What helps me shift from blame to boundary?
