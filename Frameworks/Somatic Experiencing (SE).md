# 🌿 Somatic Experiencing (SE)

**Somatic Experiencing (SE)** is a body-based trauma healing modality developed by Dr. Peter Levine. It focuses on restoring **nervous system regulation** by helping individuals **complete self-protective responses** that were interrupted during trauma.

SE emphasizes **felt-sense awareness**, micro-movements, and pacing to **avoid overwhelm** while gradually increasing capacity for presence and embodiment.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### 1. **Trauma Is in the Nervous System, Not the Event**

- It’s the _overwhelm and incomplete response_, not just the incident, that creates trauma.
- Trauma can result from too much, too fast, too soon—or too little for too long.

### 2. **Pendulation**

- Gently moving between **activation** (stress) and **resourcing** (safety).
- Helps reestablish nervous system flexibility and discharge stuck survival energy.

### 3. **Titration**

- Working with **small doses** of sensation or memory to prevent retraumatization.
- Promotes regulation and trust in the body.

### 4. **Completion of Defensive Responses**

- Supporting movements or impulses that were suppressed (e.g., fight, flight).
- Allows discharge through trembling, heat, tears, or spontaneous motion.

### 5. **Felt Sense**

- Tracking internal body sensations (tightness, warmth, tension, movement).
- Building **interoceptive awareness** to ground experience and access implicit memory.

## 🔄 SE-Informed Practice Moves

- Orienting: Gently looking around the space until something feels interesting or settling.
- Resourcing: Bringing attention to a memory, place, or internal sensation that feels supportive.
- Squeeze-and-Release: Tensing muscles for a few seconds, then letting go to reset tension.
- Noticing: “What’s happening in my body—right now? And what happens next?”

## 🧠 Nervous System States (Polyvagal Integration)

| State                    | SE Focus                                       |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Mobilized (fight/flight) | Support discharge and grounding.               |
| Freeze / Collapse        | Gently reintroduce energy and presence.        |
| Social Engagement        | Expand tolerance for connection and stillness. |

## 🛠 Relational Applications

- Supports containment in conflict by **slowing down** and **noticing body cues**.
- Enhances repair work: “I noticed I shut down—can we pause and come back?”
- Helps differentiate between past threat activation and present safety.

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- What am I sensing in my body—without needing to fix it?
- What part of me is bracing, tightening, or withdrawing?
- Where do I feel most alive, grounded, or supported right now?
- What does my body know that my mind might be overriding?
