# ⚖️ Power Exchange

**Power Exchange** refers to any **intentional, consensual transfer of authority** between people—often within kink, BDSM, or structured relationship contexts. This dynamic may be **temporary (scene-based)** or **ongoing (lifestyle or identity-based)**, and can include emotional, physical, sexual, or logistical forms of control.

Power exchange is about **agency, containment, and trust**—not coercion or entitlement.

> “You can only give power you already own.”

## 🧠 Core Forms of Power Exchange

| Type                          | Description                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Top/Bottom**                | Scene-based sensation play; limited to the moment.                        |
| **Dominant/submissive (D/s)** | One person leads, guides, or sets structure; the other yields or follows. |
| **Master/slave (M/s)**        | Often more intense, 24/7, protocol-heavy relationship hierarchy.          |
| **Caregiver/little**          | Nurturing authority, regression, ageplay, and emotional safety.           |
| **Symbolic Roles**            | Owner/pet, trainer/trainee, handler/object, etc.                          |

## 🔐 Consent Mechanisms

- **Negotiation** – Explicit discussion of limits, roles, and desires
- **Safewords** – Verbal or nonverbal cues for boundaries or stop signals
- **Aftercare** – Re-integration and emotional care following scenes
- **Reversibility** – Ethical power exchange remains revocable at any time

> Consider pairing with models like [[RACK]], [[SSC]], [[FRIES]], or [[PRICK]].

## ⚠️ Ethics & Misuse

- **Abuse Risk** – Unclear consent or dependency may lead to emotional or physical harm
- **Entitlement Fallacy** – Power is _offered_, not assumed
- **Ego Inflation** – Roles should remain accountable and grounded in shared humanity
- **Gaslighting Risk** – Particularly in psychological exchange (see [[PTPE]])

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- What _kind_ of power am I interested in exchanging (decision-making, sensation, symbolic)?
- How do I know when this power dynamic is helping me feel more safe, whole, or empowered?
- What’s the difference between **structure** and **control** in my experience?
- Which parts of me feel drawn to lead, follow, rebel, or submit?
