# ‚öñÔ∏è Power Exchange

**Power Exchange** refers to any **intentional, consensual transfer of authority** between people‚Äîoften within kink, BDSM, or structured relationship contexts. This dynamic may be **temporary (scene-based)** or **ongoing (lifestyle or identity-based)**, and can include emotional, physical, sexual, or logistical forms of control.

Power exchange is about **agency, containment, and trust**‚Äînot coercion or entitlement.

| **Dominant/submissive (D/s)** | One person leads, guides, or sets structure; the other yields or follows. |
| **Master/slave (M/s)**        | Often more intense, 24/7, protocol-heavy relationship hierarchy.          |
| **Caregiver/little**          | Nurturing authority, regression, ageplay, and emotional safety.           |
| **Symbolic Roles**            | Owner/pet, trainer/trainee, handler/object, etc.                          |
