# Boundary Models

## Overview
Conceptualizes boundaries as flexible membranes that define what's okay/not okay; dysfunction appears as porous or rigid extremes.

## Core Principles
- Healthy boundaries are clear, flexible, and responsive  
- Functional vs. controlling boundaries  
- Consent and containment shape boundary health  

## Application
- State limits, preferences, and consequences clearly  
- Use graduated requests and negotiated agreements  
- Normalize 'no' and renegotiation
