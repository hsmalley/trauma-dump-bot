# ✊ Liberation Psychology (LP)

**Liberation Psychology (LP)**, founded by Ignacio Martín-Baró, centers psychological healing within the struggle for **justice, dignity, and collective liberation**. It critiques dominant clinical models that decontextualize suffering and offers tools for **naming, resisting, and transforming oppression** through relational and community practices.

Rather than treating symptoms in isolation, LP views distress as often arising from **structural violence, cultural disconnection, and systemic power imbalances**.

## 🌍 Core Tenets

### 1. **Conscientización** (Critical Consciousness)

- Inspired by Paulo Freire.
- Awakening to the social and political roots of suffering.
- Healing begins by recognizing the broader system at play.

### 2. **De-ideologizing Experience**

- Unmask dominant narratives that uphold inequality.
- Ask: “Who defines what’s normal, broken, or valuable—and why?”

### 3. **Praxis**

- Reflection + action for justice.
- Healing includes **participating in transformation**, not just adapting to harm.

### 4. **Community-Based Healing**

- Emphasizes collective care, mutual aid, and cultural resilience.
- Rejects the myth of the “isolated individual” in favor of relational interdependence.

## 🧠 Nervous System & Trauma Lens

- LP sees trauma as **historical, systemic, and embodied**.
- Symptoms like dissociation, rage, or withdrawal may be adaptations to **colonial, racialized, or gendered oppression**.
- Reconnection with land, ancestry, and collective memory is often part of healing.

---

## 🛠 Relational Applications

- Ask: “How is this relational pattern shaped by survival within unjust systems?”
- Validate adaptive responses like fawning, hyper-independence, or code-switching.
- Support boundary-setting and voice reclamation as acts of **liberatory agency**.

---

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- What have I internalized about who gets to feel, speak, or rest?
- How does my pain reflect more than just personal history?
- What would liberation feel like—in my body, in my relationships, in my choices?
- Where do I locate justice within my healing?

## 🔄 Integration with Other Frameworks

- Complements [[Intersectional Feminist Psychology]] and [[Consent Culture]].
- Grounds parts work ([[IFS]]) in cultural and systemic context.
- Aligns with [[Containment Models]] that include cultural holding and collective care.
