# 🌼 Compassion-Focused Therapy (CFT)

**Compassion-Focused Therapy (CFT)** is an integrative therapeutic model developed by **Dr. Paul Gilbert** to help individuals overcome chronic shame, self-criticism, and emotional dysregulation by cultivating **compassion toward self and others**.

CFT blends insights from **evolutionary psychology, attachment theory, affective neuroscience, and CBT**, aiming to **rebalance the three affect regulation systems**—threat, drive, and soothing.

## 🧠 The Three Emotion Systems

| System                | Function                       | Associated Emotions           | Example States                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Threat/Protection** | Detect and respond to danger   | Fear, anxiety, shame, anger   | Self-criticism, hypervigilance |
| **Drive/Excitement**  | Seek resources and achievement | Pleasure, excitement, craving | Overwork, perfectionism        |
| **Soothing/Safeness** | Regulate and rest              | Contentment, safety, warmth   | Compassion, connection, care   |

> Imbalances (e.g., overactive threat system) often underlie chronic shame and emotional pain. CFT focuses on **activating the soothing system** through compassion practices.

## 💠 Core Components of CFT

### 1. **Psychoeducation**

- Normalize shame and self-criticism as evolutionary survival strategies.
- Understand the brain as “tricky”—not your fault.

### 2. **Compassionate Mind Training**

- Practices to develop **Compassionate Self**, a wise, strong, warm inner guide.
- Includes imagery, posture, voice tone, and behavioral rehearsal.

### 3. **Chair Work & Dialogues**

- Use chairs or journaling to externalize and dialogue between parts (e.g., critic vs Compassionate Self).

### 4. **Soothing Rhythm Breathing**

- Regulates physiology, supporting access to compassion.

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- When I feel shame, what story am I telling myself?
- What voice tone do I use with myself when I struggle?
- If I imagined someone truly kind understanding me right now, what would they say?
- What would change if I approached this situation with compassion instead of fear or drive?

## 🔄 Integration with Other Frameworks

- [[Internal Family Systems (IFS)]] — Compassionate Self = Self-energy
- [[Trauma-Informed Care]] — non-pathologizing, nervous system-aware
- [[Polyvagal Theory (PVT)]] — compassion activates ventral vagal system
- [[CBT]] — cognitive reappraisal through a compassionate lens

## ⚠️ Common Misconceptions

- **Compassion ≠ Weakness**: Compassion involves courage to face pain, not avoidance.
- **Self-Compassion ≠ Self-Indulgence**: It’s about long-term care, not short-term comfort.
- **People may fear compassion**: Especially if raised in environments where vulnerability wasn’t safe.
