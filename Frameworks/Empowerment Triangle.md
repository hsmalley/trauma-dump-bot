# 🔺 Empowerment Triangle

The **Empowerment Triangle** is a relational and intrapersonal model developed by David Emerald in _The Power of TED_. It provides a **proactive, agency-based alternative** to the reactive roles in the [[Drama Triangle]] (Victim, Rescuer, Persecutor).

Instead of reacting from fear or control, the Empowerment Triangle supports **creative problem-solving**, **emotional responsibility**, and **relational integrity**.

## 🧩 Core Roles in the Empowerment Triangle

### 1. **Creator** (vs. Victim)

- Sees challenges as opportunities for growth.
- Focuses on what _can_ be done, rather than what's wrong.
- Language: “What do I want?” “What’s the next step?”

### 2. **Coach** (vs. Rescuer)

- Supports others without overfunctioning.
- Listens, asks questions, and trusts the other’s capacity.
- Language: “What do you need?” “What’s your next move?”

### 3. **Challenger** (vs. Persecutor)

- Names truth with care and respect.
- Sets boundaries while inviting growth.
- Language: “I see your potential. Can I offer a challenge?”

## 🔄 Mapping the Shift

| Drama Triangle | Empowerment Triangle | Focus               |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Victim         | Creator              | Choice & agency     |
| Rescuer        | Coach                | Support & curiosity |
| Persecutor     | Challenger           | Truth & boundaries  |

## 🧠 Nervous System & Trauma Lens

- Empowered roles require **regulation and resourced capacity**.
- Moving from Rescuer to Coach often involves **unfusing from fawn parts**.
- Challenger requires grounded anger and relational courage, not blame.

---

## 🛠 Empowered Communication Practices

- Creator: Use “I” statements and values-based goals.
- Coach: Ask before advising: “Would it help to explore that together?”
- Challenger: Offer clear feedback with boundaries: “This doesn’t work for me—and here’s what I want instead.”

## 💬 Reflection Prompts

- What’s the small next move I can take from a Creator mindset?
- How do I know when I’m rescuing instead of coaching?
- What boundaries do I need to set in a Challenger role—with care?
