# 📖 Narrative Therapy

**Narrative Therapy** is a collaborative, post-structural approach to healing developed by Michael White and David Epston. It views **identity as shaped by stories**—about ourselves, our relationships, and the world. These stories are often constructed socially, shaped by power, culture, and lived experience.

Narrative Therapy helps people **externalize problems**, **re-author their lives**, and reconnect with values and skills that dominant or trauma-shaped narratives may have obscured.

## 🧠 Core Principles

### 1. **The Person is Not the Problem**

- Problems are _separate_ from people.
- Externalizing language ("the anxiety is loud today") fosters agency and compassion.

### 2. **Identity is Story-Based**

- We understand ourselves through stories shaped by family, culture, trauma, and resistance.
- Healing involves uncovering and **re-storying** alternate narratives.

### 3. **Meaning-Making is Political**

- Dominant cultural stories (e.g., about gender, success, worthiness) often marginalize people.
- Narrative practice **challenges internalized oppression** and centers lived truth.

### 4. **Collaborative Inquiry**

- Therapist and client are co-investigators, not expert/fixer and patient.
- Emphasis on **curiosity, consent, and cultural humility**.

## 🔍 Narrative Tools

- **Externalizing the Problem**: "When did shame first show up for you?"
- **Unique Outcomes**: Moments when the person resisted the problem's effects.
- **Re-authoring Conversations**: Highlighting neglected values, dreams, and capacities.
- **Thickening Preferred Stories**: Naming skills, relationships, and histories that support new identities.
- **Re-membering**: Reconnecting with people (living or ancestral) who affirm the person's dignity.

## 🧠 Trauma Lens

- Validates survival narratives shaped by oppression, violence, or neglect.
- Avoids retraumatization by honoring protective strategies as meaningful responses.
- Encourages gentle re-imagining of what’s possible—without shame or erasure.

## 🛠 Reflection & Practice Prompts

- What story have I inherited about who I need to be to belong?
- How did I learn to name myself—and who helped shape that?
- What is the story I want to tell about who I am becoming?
- When have I acted against the problem—what did that show about me?

## 💬 Narrative Therapy in Relationships

- Helps partners see each other as more than reactive patterns.
- Externalizes conflict scripts: “This isn’t you vs. me—it’s us vs. the fear/shutdown cycle.”
- Invites mutual curiosity: “What values are beneath our stuck points?”

## 🔄 Integration with Other Frameworks

- Complements [[Internal Family Systems (IFS)]]: parts = story-based identities.
- Aligns with [[Liberation & Intersectional Feminist Psychology]] for deconstructing oppressive narratives.
- Enhances [[Consent Culture]] by affirming voice and choice in meaning-making.
