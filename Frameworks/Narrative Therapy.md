### üß© Definition and Core Themes

**Narrative Therapy (NT)** is a **postmodern, collaborative, and non-pathologizing**
approach to counseling developed in the 1980s by **Michael White** (Australia) and
**David Epston** (New Zealand). It is founded on the idea that an individual's life is
composed of multiple stories, and that a **"problem-saturated"** dominant story can
significantly limit their identity and potential.

- **Core Philosophy:** People make meaning of their lives and construct their identities
  through **narratives** (stories composed of events linked in sequence, across time,
  according to a plot).
- **Key Mantra:** **"The problem is the problem, the person is not the problem."**
- **Therapist Stance:** The therapist maintains a **"decentered but influential"** and
  **"not-knowing"** stance, viewing the client as the **expert of their own life** and
  encouraging collaboration in the therapeutic process.

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Techniques and Interventions

Narrative Therapy uses specific conversational maps to help clients challenge the
dominant, negative stories influencing their lives and **co-author** new, more hopeful
ones.

| Technique                         | Description                                                                                                                                                          | Purpose                                                                                                                             |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Externalizing the Problem**     | Separating the person from the problem by giving the problem a name (e.g., "The Depression," "The Doubt," "The Fear").                                               | Allows the client to see the problem as an external entity they can act against, rather than an inherent personal flaw or identity. |
| **Mapping the Influence**         | Asking questions to map how the problem has affected the client's life, relationships, values, and actions.                                                          | Clearly objectifies the problem and exposes its influence, strengthening the client's position _against_ it.                        |
| **Searching for Unique Outcomes** | Actively inquiring about times when the client successfully resisted the problem's influence, or when they acted in ways that contradict the dominant problem story. | These exceptions serve as "sparkling moments" that contain the seeds of a preferred, alternative story.                             |
| **Re-Authoring Conversations**    | Systematically asking questions to "thicken" the unique outcomes into a comprehensive, preferred new narrative about the client's identity.                          | This process validates skills, commitments, and values, leading to a richer, multi-storied sense of self.                           |
| **Circulating the New Story**     | Creating documents (e.g., letters, certificates, declarations) that summarize the new narrative and share it with significant others (a "narrative community").      | Solidifies the new story by getting external witnesses to validate the client's preferred identity and changes.                     |

### üß† Postmodern and Social Context

Narrative therapy is deeply rooted in **social constructionism** and **postmodern
thought**, acknowledging that:

1. **Reality is Socially Constructed:** The meaning people assign to events is shaped by
   culture, language, and the "dominant discourses" of society (e.g., cultural
   expectations around gender, race, or success).
2. **Problems are Discursive:** Problems often gain power because they align with these
   dominant cultural discourses, leading to "single-storied" identities that pathologize
   and limit people. NT seeks to help clients **deconstruct** these disempowering
   cultural influences.
