### üß© Definition and Core Themes

**Restorative Justice (RJ)** is a philosophy and social movement that views conflict or crime as a violation of **people and relationships**, not just a violation of law or rules. Its central goal is to **repair the harm** caused by the conflict through a cooperative process involving the victim(s), the offender(s), and, where appropriate, the community.

-   **Core Goal:** To shift the focus from **punishment** and **blame** to **needs** and **repair**. The primary question changes from *"What rule was broken?"* to *"Who was harmed, and what is needed to make things right?"*
-   **Central Tenets (The Three Pillars):**
    1.  **Encounter:** Creating a safe, structured opportunity for those affected to meet and dialogue.
    2.  **Repair:** Focusing on concrete steps the person who caused harm will take to address the injuries (physical, emotional, or material).
    3.  **Transformation:** Addressing the root causes of the harm and preventing future reoccurrence by fostering systemic change or community dialogue.
-   **Accountability:** True accountability is achieved when the person who caused the harm **takes personal responsibility** for their actions and actively participates in the repair process, rather than passively receiving a punishment.

### üåø Key Practices and Models

Restorative Justice is implemented through several structured practices designed to facilitate dialogue and repair.

| Practice | Description | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Victim-Offender Mediation (VOM)** | A facilitated, direct meeting between the victim and the person who caused harm to discuss the event and agree on restitution. | Individualized repair and empathy building. |
| **Family Group Conferencing (FGC)** | Widens the circle to include family and support systems of both the victim and the offender to collectively create a comprehensive plan for repair. | Social support and system-level intervention. |
| **Restorative Circles** | A highly structured community process, often using a talking piece, to allow all affected community members (including those not directly harmed) to share impact and devise a plan. | Community-wide healing and conflict management. |

### üß† Psychological and Relational Impact

RJ is effective because it meets fundamental psychological needs often ignored by punitive systems, which focus primarily on retribution.

-   **Validation and Empowerment (Victim):** Being able to tell their story, have their harm fully acknowledged by the responsible party, and participate in defining the solution is profoundly **validating** and restores the victim's **agency**.
-   **Empathy and Moral Development (Offender):** By confronting the human impact of their actions directly (face-to-face), the person who caused harm moves from abstract guilt to concrete **empathy**, which is the most powerful catalyst for genuine, internal change and reduced recidivism.
-   **Safety and Co-Regulation:** The circle format, led by a calm, neutral **Facilitator**, provides a strong **Ventral Vagal (Safe and Social)** cue, which helps contain the intense emotions of the discussion and prevent the parties from moving into a defensive or dissociated state (**Trauma Response**).

### üõ†Ô∏è Application Settings

RJ principles are increasingly applied in diverse settings beyond the criminal justice system:

-   **Educational Institutions:** Used to address bullying, rule infractions, and conflicts between students/teachers by focusing on repairing relationships and setting new, shared community norms.
-   **Organizational and Workplace Conflict:** Used to address harassment, discrimination, or toxic work environments, emphasizing systemic change and relational repair over firing or legal action alone.
-   **Community Building:** Used proactively (before harm occurs) to build strong, resilient communities capable of addressing conflict internally.
