### 🧩 Definition and Core Themes

Trauma Informed Care (TIC) is a systemic framework that assumes an individual has a history of trauma ("What happened to you?") and seeks to prevent re-traumatization in all interactions. It is built on six core principles: Safety, Trustworthiness, Peer Support, Collaboration, Empowerment, and Cultural/Historical Consideration.

- **Origin Context:** Public health and mental health sectors (SAMHSA) in the early 2000s.
- **Key Assumptions:** All difficult behavior is a survival mechanism. Safety is non-negotiable and must be actively cued.

### 🌿 Traits and Lived Experience

- **Lived Experience (Empowered):** Feeling that one's lived experience is honored, validated, and that collaboration is genuine (not coercive).
- **Warning Signs:** Feeling ambushed, controlled, or having choices removed (re-traumatization).
- **Disability Justice:** Awareness that systems often fail to offer predictable, accessible, and dignified care, compounding relational trauma.

### 🧠 Nervous System and Parts Work Lens

- **Core Goal:** To maintain the **Ventral Vagal (Safe)** state by maximizing **Predictability** and **Choice** in the relational environment.
- **Re-Traumatization:** Any action that cues danger or removes autonomy will immediately activate **Sympathetic** or **Dorsal** survival states.
- **Manager Part:** Can operate as a **Gatekeeper of Safety**, requiring clear, reliable, and predictable communication before relaxing its defenses.

### 💞 Attachment and Relational Patterns

- **Repair:** Requires **explicit** commitment to making amends and changing the systemic patterns that caused the rupture. Vague apologies are insufficient.
- **Trustworthiness:** Building trust by honoring small agreements and making communication transparent (consistent actions over words).

| "Being trauma-informed means I can't be firm." | "Being trauma-informed means being **clear and predictable**, not permissive; boundaries can be held with compassion."                          |
| "They are reacting too intensely."             | "Their intense reaction is a signal that their survival system is highly activated; the goal is to **co-regulate**, not dismiss the intensity." |

### ⚖️ Relational Challenges and Strengths

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The Safety Paradox:** The trauma survivor may push away the very safety they need due to prior negative conditioning. | **Empowerment and Voice:** Prioritizes the individual's right to define their own safety and collaborate on their care plan.        |
| **Top-Down Decision Making:** Making decisions _for_ a partner without their full input, removing choice/autonomy.      | **Predictability and Trust:** Creates relational containers that are reliable, transparent, and structurally resistant to coercion. |

### 🛠️ Strategies, Prompts, and Practices

- **Reflection Prompt:** "In this last interaction, did I honor my partner's **Empowerment** and **Choice**? If not, what core need was I prioritizing instead?"
- **Micro-Skill (Collaboration):** Frame all care requests as a joint effort: "How can _we_ work together to make sure you feel supported and safe through this?"
- **Micro-Skill (Setting Boundaries):** Always provide a rationale for a boundary to cue predictability: "I need to take space now, **because** I need to process my feelings before I can be calm (NVC Need: Calmness)."
