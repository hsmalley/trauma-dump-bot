# Post Traumatic Stress Disorder — Framework Notes

> Action-focused, trauma-informed guide for recognizing, assessing risk, stabilizing,
> and coordinating multidisciplinary care for people with PTSD or trauma-related
> distress.

---

## Purpose

- Provide a compact, evidence-aligned template for rapid clinical assessment,
  medical/psychiatric triage, brief interventions, and care coordination for PTSD across
  settings.
  [oai_citation:0‡NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng116/chapter/recommendations?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

## Scope & Audience

- Designed for frontline clinicians (ED, primary care), mental-health practitioners,
  school health teams, occupational health, and care coordinators.
- Applies to adults and young people with acute or chronic PTSD presentations, including
  Complex PTSD (CPTSD) where relevant; specialist referral recommended for complex,
  refractory, or high-risk cases.

## Quick Immediate Checklist (first 5–10 minutes)

1. **Is the person in immediate danger?** Ask directly about suicidal ideation, intent,
   or plans; if present or if acute safety concerns exist, activate emergency pathways.
   [oai_citation:2‡PTSD.gov](https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/treat/txessentials/cpg_ptsd_management.asp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
2. **Medical stability:** assess airway/breathing/circulation if physically compromised;
   treat acute intoxication or withdrawal as indicated.
3. **Contain distress:** use grounding/containment techniques (calm presence, orienting
   statements, breathing regulation) while arranging privacy and safety.
4. **Limit retraumatization:** avoid invasive recounting of trauma unless clinically
   indicated and therapeutic; obtain consent for trauma discussion.
5. **Document & notify:** record verbatim distress statements, immediate risk
   indicators, and notify on-call mental-health services or crisis teams as per
   protocol.

## Structured Assessment (core domains)

- **Trauma exposure (Criterion A context):** type of trauma, timing, single vs. repeated
  events, interpersonal trauma, childhood/adult onset. (DSM-5/DSM-5-TR definitions
  inform diagnostic thresholds).
  [oai_citation:3‡PTSD.gov](https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/treat/essentials/dsm5_ptsd.asp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Symptom clusters:** intrusive memories/flashbacks/nightmares; avoidance of
  reminders; negative alterations in cognition/mood; hyperarousal/reactivity; functional
  impairment; duration (>1 month).
  [oai_citation:4‡PTSD.gov](https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/treat/essentials/dsm5_ptsd.asp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Severity & course:** acute stress vs. persistent PTSD, symptom frequency/intensity,
  triggers, dissociation.
- **Comorbidity:** depression, anxiety, substance use, TBI, pain, sleep disorders—assess
  for overlapping drivers of risk and impairment.
- **Risk assessment:** suicidal ideation/intent, self-harm, aggression, severe
  dissociation, psychosis, unstable housing, lack of supports.
  [oai_citation:5‡PTSD.gov](https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/treat/txessentials/cpg_ptsd_management.asp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Social & cultural context:** stigma, family responses, legal, migration or asylum
  issues, cultural idioms of distress.
- **Functional assessment:** impact on work/school, relationships, daily self-care,
  ability to engage in therapy.

---

## Risk Stratification (practical triage)

- **Low risk / outpatient:** PTSD symptoms present but medically stable, no suicidality
  or major comorbidity, reliable supports, and rapid access to trauma-focused therapy —
  arrange outpatient trauma-focused psychotherapy and safety plan.
  [oai_citation:6‡NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng116/chapter/recommendations?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Moderate risk / urgent follow-up:** marked functional impairment, comorbid severe
  anxiety/depression or substance use, intermittent suicidal ideation without plan,
  limited supports — consider expedited outpatient pathways, intensive outpatient/day
  program, or brief observation.
  [oai_citation:7‡PTSD.gov](https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/treat/txessentials/cpg_ptsd_management.asp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **High / immediate risk:** active suicidal intent or plan, severe dissociation with
  loss of capacity, acute intoxication or withdrawal with medical risk, or severe
  medical instability — emergency admission (medical or psychiatric as appropriate) and
  multidisciplinary stabilization.
  [oai_citation:8‡PTSD.gov](https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/treat/txessentials/cpg_ptsd_management.asp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Intervention / Response Framework (evidence-aligned immediate strategies)

- **Stabilization first:** address immediate safety (suicide risk), medical needs, and
  crisis stabilization (sleep/medication management if needed).
- **Psychoeducation & grounding:** brief, trauma-informed education about normal stress
  responses, sleep hygiene, and self-soothing tools; provide written resources and
  crisis contacts.
- **Trauma-focused psychotherapy:** recommend trauma-focused, manualized therapies as
  first-line where available — examples include Trauma-Focused CBT variants (CPT, CT for
  PTSD, Prolonged Exposure) and EMDR. These modalities have the strongest RCT support
  for PTSD symptom reduction.
  [oai_citation:9‡PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32284821/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Pharmacotherapy:** consider SSRIs/SNRIs for symptom reduction when indicated (e.g.,
  comorbid depression/anxiety or when psychotherapy is inaccessible); use medication as
  adjunct rather than sole curative approach. Consult psychiatry for complex regimens or
  polypharmacy.
  [oai_citation:10‡PTSD.gov](https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/treat/txessentials/cpg_ptsd_management.asp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Address comorbidities:** treat substance use, sleep disorders, and pain
  concurrently; some comorbidities increase risk and impede PTSD treatment engagement.
- **Special populations:** adapt approaches for children/adolescents, older adults,
  survivors of complex interpersonal trauma (CPTSD), and people with TBI or severe
  dissociation — specialist input recommended.

## Communication & Trauma-Informed Interaction Tips

- Use calm, validating, and nonjudgmental language; avoid re-traumatizing prompts and
  respect pacing — ask for consent before exploring trauma narratives.
- Normalize common reactions (hypervigilance, nightmares) while validating suffering;
  emphasize agency and collaborative planning.
- Be identity-conscious: use gender-affirming and culturally sensitive phrasing;
  recognize how discrimination and intersectional factors can compound trauma.
- When working with neurodivergent or dissociative presentations, allow flexibility in
  communication (visual aids, breaks, simplified language).

---

## Documentation Template (minimum fields)

- Date/time, clinician, setting, contact method (in-person/telehealth)
- Presenting complaint and brief trauma history (with consent)
- Symptom clusters and severity, screening tool scores if used (e.g., PCL-5), functional
  impact
- Medical/psychiatric risk assessment (suicidality/self-harm, dissociation, substance
  use)
- Immediate actions taken (safety plan, medications given, referrals made)
- Disposition and rationale (admit/observe/outpatient + follow-up plan)
- Communication with supports (consent status), referrals and handoff notes

---

## Care Coordination & Follow-up

- **Before discharge:** provide a written safety plan, crisis contacts, harm-reduction
  steps (e.g., substance safety), and clear next-step appointments (ideally within 7
  days for moderate/high risk).
  [oai_citation:12‡NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng116/chapter/recommendations?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Referral pathways:** prioritize expedited access to trauma-focused therapy; if
  unavailable, arrange interim supports (CBT for comorbid symptoms, psychiatric
  follow-up).
- **Active outreach:** consider proactive follow-up calls/texts for high-risk or
  disengaged patients; document outreach attempts and outcomes.
- **Multidisciplinary handoff:** send concise summary to receiving clinician/team with
  current risk status, treatments initiated, and outstanding needs.

---

## Postvention and Staff Support

- After traumatic incidents or patient suicidality, provide structured debriefing for
  staff, access to supervision, and mental-health supports for responders.
- For community or group exposures (e.g., mass trauma, workplace incidents), coordinate
  with public health/occupational teams to offer targeted psychological first aid and
  stepped care resources.

---

## Ethical & Legal Considerations

- Know local laws about capacity, consent, mandatory reporting, and involuntary
  treatment; mal-adaptive risk decisions may require involving guardians or legal
  pathways per jurisdiction.
- Obtain informed consent for treatment and for disclosure to third parties; be explicit
  about limits to confidentiality related to safety.
- Balance patient autonomy with duty to protect in cases of severe self-harm risk,
  documenting rationale and steps taken.
