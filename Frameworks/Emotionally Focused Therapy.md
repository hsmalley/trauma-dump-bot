### üß© Definition and Core Themes

**Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)**, primarily developed by Dr. Sue Johnson, is a
highly effective, short-term therapeutic approach for couples, families, and
individuals. It is grounded in **Attachment Theory** and focuses on identifying,
accessing, and reorganizing the emotional responses that maintain conflict and distance
in intimate relationships. EFT does not focus on behavior or cognition alone, but on the
**underlying emotional experience** that drives those patterns.

- **Core Goal:** To create a more **secure emotional bond** between partners by helping
  them recognize and articulate their deepest attachment needs (for safety, closeness,
  and responsiveness).
- **The Attachment Lens:** Conflict is reframed not as a clash of personalities or
  wills, but as a **protest against disconnection**. When a partner feels their need for
  safety or accessibility is threatened, they react with fight/flight behaviors that
  push the other away.
- **The Negative Cycle:** EFT works to map, de-escalate, and restructure the **Negative
  Cycle**‚Äîthe predictable, repetitive interaction pattern that partners get stuck in
  (e.g., the **"Pursuer-Distancer"** dance).

### üåø Traits and Lived Experience

EFT shifts the focus from external, blaming conflicts to internal, vulnerable attachment
needs, creating a path for emotional deepening.

- **Three Stages of EFT:**
  1. **De-escalation:** Identifying and mapping the negative cycle so the couple sees
     the cycle, not the partner, as the enemy.
  2. **Restructuring:** Accessing the partners' **unmet attachment needs** (e.g., "I
     need to know you are there for me") and having them express those needs to each
     other from a place of vulnerability.
  3. **Consolidation:** Solidifying new patterns of interaction and developing new
     solutions to old problems from a place of secure connection.
- **Vulnerability as Strength:** The lived experience shifts from defending rigid
  positions (e.g., "You always criticize me") to expressing vulnerable, primary emotions
  (e.g., **"When you criticize me, I feel unlovable and afraid of losing you"**).

### üß† Nervous System and Parts Work Lens

EFT directly targets the nervous system by utilizing the power of co-regulation to
resolve trauma and repair ruptures.

- **Co-Regulation as Healing (PVT):** EFT uses the partner as the primary healing agent.
  When one partner is in distress (Sympathetic Activation), the other partner is guided
  to offer consistent, loving, and regulated **Ventral Vagal (Safe and Social)** cues
  (soft voice, sustained eye contact, physical presence), effectively co-regulating the
  distressed partner back to a state of calm.
- **Accessing Primary Emotion (Parts Work):** The framework distinguishes between
  **Secondary/Reactive Emotions** (anger, defensiveness, frustration) and underlying
  **Primary/Vulnerable Emotions** (fear, sadness, loneliness). The therapist helps the
  client bypass the aggressive **Protector Parts** to access and articulate the softer,
  wounded **Exile Parts** (the attachment fear).
- **Secure Base Activation:** The therapy continually reinforces the emotional safety of
  the relationship, allowing the nervous system to perceive the partner as a reliable
  **Secure Base**, which is essential for emotional risk-taking.

### üíû Attachment and Relational Patterns

EFT is essentially a model for deliberately moving couples from **Insecure Attachment**
patterns to a consolidated **Secure Attachment** bond.

- **The Pursuer-Distancer Cycle (Insecure Dance):**
    - **Pursuer (Anxious Attachment):** Expresses attachment anxiety through seeking
    proximity, often escalating into criticism or demanding behavior to get a response.
    Their primary emotion is **fear of abandonment**.
    - **Distancer (Avoidant Attachment):** Responds to pursuit by withdrawing, shutting
    down, or intellectualizing to manage emotional overwhelm. Their primary emotion is
    **fear of engulfment/failure**.
- **The Hold Me Tight Experience:** Successful EFT creates **"corrective emotional
  experiences"** where the partner, who previously failed to respond, is now emotionally
  available, responsive, and engaged (**A.R.E. - Accessible, Responsive, Engaged**).
  This direct experience of being seen and held resolves the core attachment injuries.

| "EFT just makes people talk about their feelings." | "EFT is about **identifying the underlying needs behind the feelings** and restructuring the emotional responses to create a new, safe, and reliable bond."                         |
| "The core problem is poor communication."          | "Poor communication is a **symptom**, not the cause. The core problem is **attachment insecurity**. Improving communication is only sustainable once the emotional bond is secure." |

| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Individual Resistance:** A partner (often the Distancer/Avoidant) may intensely resist the demand for vulnerable, emotional self-disclosure, leading to slow progress in the initial stages. | **High Efficacy and Durability:** EFT has one of the highest success rates (70-75% recovery) and its positive effects tend to be stable over time, as the change is deep and emotional.    |
| **Therapist Burden:** Requires the therapist to be highly skilled at tracking complex emotional processes and remaining non-anxious while holding intense vulnerability and distress.          | **Universal Application:** The model's foundation in Attachment Theory makes it applicable across diverse couples, cultures, and orientations, as the need for a secure bond is universal. |

### üõ†Ô∏è Strategies, Prompts, and Practices

- **Micro-Skill (Reflecting the Cycle):** The therapist acts as the cycle cartographer:
  _"When you (A) criticize him, he (B) shuts down, and that causes you (A) to criticize
  more. Do you see how your attempts to get close end up pushing him away?"_
- **Prompt (Accessing Primary Emotion):** When a partner expresses anger (secondary
  emotion), the therapist gently redirects: _"Underneath the frustration right now... if
  I strip all the fight away... what is the scared, quiet feeling that surfaces? What
  are you afraid of?"_
- **Micro-Skill (The Softening):** Guiding the previously defensive partner (often the
  Distancer) to articulate their vulnerability and then physically reaching out to their
  partner. _"Can you tell her, right now, how scared you are that you will let her
  down?"_
