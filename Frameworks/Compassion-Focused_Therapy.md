### üß© Definition and Core Themes

**Compassion-Focused Therapy (CFT)**, developed by Paul Gilbert, is an integrative, evolutionary-based therapeutic approach. It is primarily designed to help individuals who struggle with high levels of **shame** and **self-criticism** by cultivating feelings of warmth, safety, soothing, and self-acceptance. CFT posits that humans have evolved with three primary emotional regulation systems.

- **The Three Affect Regulation Systems:**
  1.  **Threat System:** Focused on safety and protection (e.g., anxiety, anger, disgust).
  2.  **Drive System:** Focused on achieving, consuming, and pursuing resources (e.g., excitement, effort, motivation).
  3.  **Soothing/Affiliative System:** Focused on contentment, kindness, and connectedness; regulated by parasympathetic activity and oxytocin (e.g., calm, kindness, self-compassion).
- **Core Goal:** To consciously activate and strengthen the **Soothing System** to balance the over-activation of the Threat and Drive systems that lead to anxiety, depression, and burnout.

### üåø Traits and Lived Experience

CFT helps clients reframe intense self-criticism, which is often experienced as an overwhelming inner voice, into a sense of safety and inner support.

- **Reframing Shame:** The lived experience shifts from viewing the self-critic as an accurate assessment (leading to shame) to viewing it as a **protective, yet poorly adapted, pattern** generated by the Threat System.
- **The Three Flows of Compassion:** Cultivating compassion involves three directions:
  1.  **Giving Compassion:** Being open to the suffering of others.
  2.  **Receiving Compassion:** Allowing kindness and care from others.
  3.  **Self-Compassion:** Offering kindness and care to one's own suffering.
- **The Soothing Feeling:** Practicing compassion-focused techniques (like the **Compassionate Mind Training**) induces a physical, embodied feeling of **calm and warmth**, directly countering the physiological arousal of fear or drive.

### üß† Nervous System and Parts Work Lens

CFT directly targets the neurobiology of self-regulation and emotional security.

- **Ventral Vagal Activation (PVT):** The practices (e.g., visualizing a compassionate self-figure, gentle rhythmic breathing) are powerful activators of the **Ventral Vagal (Safe and Social)** branch of the nervous system. This intentional activation calms the heart rate, slows breathing, and promotes feelings of warmth and safety, effectively down-regulating the Threat System.
- **The Compassionate Self (IFS):** CFT's goal is to cultivate a **Compassionate Self**‚Äîa version of the **Self-energy** that is intentionally characterized by the attributes of compassion: _wisdom, strength, warmth, non-judgment, and courage_. This Compassionate Self becomes the internal resource that can safely approach and soothe wounded or self-critical parts.
- **Befriending the Critic (IFS):** The often-harsh inner critic is viewed as a **Protective Manager Part** that is trying to keep the person safe from judgment, failure, or attack. CFT does not fight the critic but uses the Compassionate Self to understand the critic's intent and offer it a more effective, kinder role.

### üíû Attachment and Relational Patterns

CFT addresses the relational need for safety and connection, often compensating for early relational failures.

- **Internalizing a Secure Base:** For individuals with histories of trauma or **Disorganized/Avoidant Attachment**, CFT provides an internal, reliable **Secure Base** (the Compassionate Self) when a reliable external figure was missing. This internal resource helps regulate distress and enables safer exploration of external relationships.
- **Countering Shame in Intimacy:** Shame and fear of rejection are major barriers to intimacy. By reducing self-criticism, CFT lowers the hypersensitivity to perceived judgment, allowing the individual to show up more authentically and vulnerably, improving the capacity for **Secure Attachment**.
- **Relational Contagion:** Learning to activate the Soothing System for oneself enhances the ability to offer genuine, regulated **co-regulation** to a partner, strengthening the overall relationship system's resilience to conflict.

| **Resistance to Receiving:** Individuals with severe shame or trauma histories often experience intense distress or resistance when trying to receive kindness from self or others (difficulty activating the Soothing System). | **Trauma-Informed Focus:** Its grounding in evolutionary biology and affect systems makes it highly effective and accessible for clients with high shame, trauma, and complex emotional dysregulation. |
| **Intellectualization:** Risk of viewing the Compassionate Self as a concept rather than an **embodied, felt experience**, requiring intentional focus on sensory and bodily practices (e.g., tone of voice, posture).          | **Holistic Regulation:** Provides a clear, scientifically grounded framework for emotional regulation that goes beyond cognitive change, engaging the body and the nervous system directly.            |

### üõ†Ô∏è Strategies, Prompts, and Practices

- **Micro-Skill (The Compassionate Anchor):** Focus on the three qualities of compassion: a **gentle, warm tone** of voice, a **soft facial expression**, and **slow, rhythmic breathing**. Use this anchor when feeling activated.
- **Prompt (The Compassionate Self-Figure):** Ask the client to visualize or draw an ideal **Compassionate Self-Figure** (imagined being, wise animal, future self) that possesses unconditional wisdom and strength. Have them practice receiving a soothing message from this figure.
- **Micro-Skill (A Functional Analysis of Criticism):** Analyze the self-criticism: *"What is this self-critic actually *trying* to help me avoid (e.g., failure, rejection)? Is it effective, or is it causing more pain?"*
