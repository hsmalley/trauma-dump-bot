# 🎉 Swinging

**Swinging** is a form of **Ethical Non-Monogamy (ENM)** where individuals—often in committed partnerships—**consensually engage in sexual activity with others**, typically for recreation, exploration, or novelty. It is commonly practiced in **group, party, or club settings**, and may or may not involve emotional connection beyond the physical.

Swinging emphasizes **shared experience, sexual openness, and consent**, often with clearly defined boundaries.

## 🧠 Core Characteristics

### 1. **Couple-Centric Orientation**

- Most swinging occurs in the context of an established dyad (e.g., married or long-term couples).
- Emphasis is often on **joint participation** or mutual agreements.

### 2. **Recreational Focus**

- Generally prioritizes **sexual variety and exploration** over romantic attachment.
- May involve same-room, separate-room, or group play.

### 3. **Consent & Communication**

- Often includes detailed **pre-negotiation**: boundaries, limits, safer sex practices.
- Disclosure and post-event check-ins are common.
