# 🌿 Decolonizing Therapy

**Decolonizing Therapy** is a liberatory healing framework that seeks to **unlearn the colonial, white supremacist, cisheteropatriarchal, and capitalist values embedded in traditional mental health models**. It reconnects therapy and healing to **ancestral wisdom, systemic awareness, and community resilience**, especially for BIPOC, queer, disabled, and diasporic people.

> “What if our rage, grief, and resistance were not pathologies—but wisdom?”
