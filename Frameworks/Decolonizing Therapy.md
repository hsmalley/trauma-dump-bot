### üß© Definition and Core Themes

**Decolonizing Therapy** is a critical, systemic, and relational movement within mental
health that seeks to dismantle the lingering, often invisible, power structures
inherited from Western colonialism within therapeutic practice. It challenges the
assumption that Eurocentric models (like CBT, psychoanalysis, or even the concept of the
individual self) are universally applicable or superior.

- **Core Goal:** To shift practice from **cultural competence** (knowing about different
  cultures) to **cultural humility** (an ongoing commitment to self-reflection and
  recognizing the client as the expert on their own experience).
- **Key Dynamics:** Focuses on the impact of **structural oppression, historical trauma,
  and systemic racism** on mental health. It advocates for integrating Indigenous,
  African, Asian, and other non-Western healing modalities and epistemologies into the
  clinical landscape.
- **Power in the Room:** Recognizes and actively addresses the inherent **power
  imbalance** between the therapist (who holds institutional knowledge and social
  privilege) and the client.

### üåø Traits and Lived Experience

The practice of decolonizing therapy shifts the focus from individual pathology to
systemic context.

- **Lived Experience (Client):** The client moves from feeling pressured to conform to
  Western mental health norms (e.g., individualism, emotional expressiveness) to feeling
  **seen and validated** within their specific cultural, familial, and political
  context. Healing is reframed as **liberation and resistance**, not just adjustment.
- **Lived Experience (Therapist):** The therapist engages in continuous
  **self-interrogation** regarding their own biases, privilege, and the colonial origins
  of their training. This requires shifting from the role of the **"expert healer"** to
  that of a **"co-learner"** or facilitator.
- **Challenging Individualism:** Pathology is often reframed from "my personal
  depression" to **"my systemic exhaustion"** or **"my historical grief,"** recognizing
  the communal and intergenerational sources of distress.

### üß† Nervous System and Parts Work Lens

Decolonizing therapy provides a systemic, shame-reducing perspective on the body's
trauma response.

- **Trauma as Systemic (PVT):** The chronic hyper-vigilance, anxiety, and distrust
  experienced by marginalized groups are framed as a predictable, rational, and
  persistent **Sympathetic Activation (Fight/Flight)**‚Äîa survival response to an
  environment that is genuinely unsafe due to structural oppression.
- **De-pathologizing Defenses (IFS):** Protective Parts (e.g., The Watcher, The Pleaser,
  The Dissociator) are not seen as problems to be fixed, but as **ingenious,
  context-specific adaptations** developed to survive colonial, racist, or oppressive
  environments. The therapy validates the wisdom of these Parts.
- **Communal Soothing:** Healing focuses less on individual cognitive restructuring
  (CBT) and more on **Communal Co-Regulation**, incorporating modalities like ceremony,
  storytelling, or spiritual practices that are culturally sanctioned ways of activating
  the **Ventral Vagal (Safe and Social)** system within a collective.

### üíû Attachment and Relational Patterns

The framework expands the concept of attachment beyond the nuclear family to encompass
the community and ancestry.

- **Collective Attachment:** **Attachment** is seen as extending not only to early
  caregivers but also to one's **community, ancestors, land, and spiritual traditions**.
  Rupture of these ties (e.g., forced removal, cultural genocide) is recognized as a
  profound form of relational trauma.
- **Addressing Historical Trauma:** The emotional dysregulation within a family system
  is often traced back to **Intergenerational Trauma** (e.g., slavery, residential
  schools, war), validating the client's present-day struggles as an active link to
  historical pain.
- **Relational Integrity:** The therapist models relational integrity by actively naming
  and disrupting colonial dynamics in the session (e.g., correcting racial
  microaggressions, shifting language away from pathologizing terms), establishing a
  **Secure Base** rooted in anti-oppressive ethics.

| **Tokenism Risk:** The risk that therapists incorporate Indigenous or POC practices superficially without fully engaging with the underlying political and ethical commitments.                                              | **Increased Relevance:** Increases the relevance and efficacy of therapy for BIPOC and marginalized clients by centering their actual lived experiences of oppression.              |
| **Systemic Pressure:** Therapists often face pressure from insurance, institutional policies, and licensing boards (which are themselves colonial structures) that prioritize quick fixes over holistic, contextual healing. | **Ethical Accountability:** Provides a clear ethical compass for the therapist to continuously interrogate power, privilege, and the political implications of their clinical work. |

### üõ†Ô∏è Strategies, Prompts, and Practices

- **Therapist Micro-Skill (Self-Location):** The therapist begins sessions or
  discussions by briefly acknowledging their own social location (race, class, gender,
  and ancestral heritage) to model transparency and recognize their privilege.
- **Prompt (Cultural Lens):** Ask the client: _"How does your community, your ancestors,
  or your spiritual tradition understand this problem? If you brought this distress to
  your elders, what would they tell you to do?"_
- **Micro-Skill (Reframing Defiance):** When a client is defiant or resistant to a
  therapeutic task, reframe it not as a personal failure, but as **"relational
  intelligence"**‚Äîa healthy boundary or resistance to a system that has historically
  harmed them.
