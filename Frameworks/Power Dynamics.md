### üß© Definition and Core Themes

**Power dynamics** refers to the constant, shifting, and often unconscious ways that
power operates and is distributed within and between individuals, groups, and systems.
Power is generally defined as the **ability to influence or control** the behavior of
others and/or to resist their influence. Understanding these dynamics is crucial because
they profoundly affect communication, conflict resolution, equity, and mental health.

- **Core Goal:** To make unconscious power structures conscious, facilitating equitable
  relationships and resisting harmful systemic influences.
- **Power is Relational:** Power is not a static possession but a
  **relationship-dependent phenomenon**. It is exercised and negotiated in every
  interaction.
- **Power is Contextual:** An individual's power changes depending on the social
  context. For example, a person may hold high positional power at work but low power in
  their family unit.
- **The Crucial Distinction: Power vs. Control:** **Power** is the capacity to act or
  influence. **Control** is the _act_ of restricting another's autonomy. Healthy
  relationships aim for **shared power** (empowerment); unhealthy ones feature
  **coercive control**.

### üåø Forms and Sources of Power

Power is not monolithic; it originates from various sources, which often interact and
reinforce one another.

#### 1. Individual/Relational Power

These sources emerge from personal attributes and interactional strategies:

- **Expert Power:** Based on specialized knowledge or skill (e.g., a mechanic, a
  therapist).
- **Referent Power:** Based on admiration, respect, or personal charisma (e.g., a
  beloved leader).
- **Legitimate Power:** Based on a formal position or role (e.g., parent, boss,
  teacher).
- **Coercive Power:** Based on the ability to inflict punishment or harm.
- **Reward Power:** Based on the ability to grant benefits or resources.

#### 2. Systemic/Structural Power

These sources, emphasized by **Intersectional Feminist Psychology**, derive from the
social system and are often unearned:

- **Dominant Group Power (Privilege):** Power held by membership in historically
  dominant social categories (e.g., being male, white, cisgender, wealthy). This power
  is often **invisible** to the holder.
- **Institutional Power:** Power vested in organizational and legal structures (e.g.,
  government, police, educational systems) that enforce inequality.
- **Power of the Narrative:** Control over media, education, and cultural discourse
  (hegemony), which shapes what is considered "normal" or "true."

### üß† Psychology and Power

Unacknowledged power dynamics are major contributors to relational and psychological
distress.

- **Gaslighting and Psychological Abuse:** These tactics are attempts to establish
  **Coercive Power** by undermining the victim's perception of reality, confidence, and
  sanity, aiming for total psychological control.
- **Internalized Oppression:** When systemic power structures are absorbed, the
  marginalized person adopts the dominant group's negative self-view. This can manifest
  as an abusive **Internal Family Systems (IFS) Manager Part** (Inner Critic) that
  polices the self.
- **Nervous System Regulation (PVT):** Experiencing chronic disempowerment (low
  relational power, high systemic oppression) maintains the nervous system in a constant
  state of **Sympathetic Hyper-vigilance (Threat)**, as agency is consistently denied.

### üíû Relational Patterns and Equity

In therapy, addressing power dynamics means seeking a transition from unhealthy,
controlling patterns to equitable, empowering ones.

- **The Therapeutic Dyad:** The therapist naturally holds **Expert Power** and
  **Legitimate Power**. Ethical practice requires the therapist to explicitly address
  and **mitigate this power differential** by prioritizing client autonomy and
  self-determination.
- **Conflict Dynamics:** In a relationship, the partner with higher **Systemic Power**
  (e.g., higher income, social privilege) often has less incentive to change, as the
  status quo benefits them. Effective **Conflict Repair** requires a commitment from the
  privileged partner to use their power to advocate for **equity**.
- **Empowerment:** The goal of healthy relational work is to transition from **Power
  Over** (coercion, control, domination) to **Power With** (collaboration, mutual
  influence) and **Power To** (individual capacity and agency).

### üõ†Ô∏è Strategies, Prompts, and Practices

- **Micro-Skill (Airing the Privilege):** In couples therapy, facilitate a discussion
  about specific power differentials: _"How does the difference in who manages the money
  or who has social privilege affect how this problem is experienced by each of you?"_
- **Prompt (Tracking Influence):** Ask the client to track a recent disagreement: _"Who
  did the most talking? Whose plan was ultimately enacted? What resources (time, money,
  social capital) were used to influence the outcome?"_
- **Micro-Skill (Boundary Check):** Use **Boundary Models** to ensure both individuals
  have the power to say "no" without fear of relational or emotional punishment (i.e.,
  testing for **Coercive Power**).
