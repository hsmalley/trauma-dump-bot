# ðŸ“– Frameworks Overview

This guide maps the vault's core psychological models by their **primary function**. Use
this overview to quickly select the right theoretical lens when you are analyzing a
conflict or planning a session.

## I. Body & Regulation Models (What is my state?)

These frameworks help you understand and manage the physical, biological state of the
nervous system. They are crucial for **self-soothing and co-regulation**.

| Framework                      | Primary Focus                                                         | Key Utility                                                                    |
| :----------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[[Polyvagal Theory (PVT)]]** | **Nervous System States** (Ventral Vagal, Sympathetic, Dorsal Vagal). | Naming and tracking physical safety/danger states; immediate de-escalation.    |
| **MBSR (Mindfulness)**         | **Present Moment Awareness** and non-judgmental attention.            | Creating a pause between trigger and reaction; reducing stress and reactivity. |

## II. Internal Structure & Story Models (What is driving me?)

These frameworks help you understand the internal architecture of the self, emotional
burdens, and the source of emotional intensity.

| Framework                             | Primary Focus                                                      | Key Utility                                                                                   |
| :------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[[Internal Family Systems (IFS)]]** | **Parts** (Protectors, Exiles) and **Self-Energy**.                | Separating the "Part" that reacted from the "Self" that observes; deep healing of old wounds. |
| **ACT (Cognitive Fusion)**            | **Thoughts as Events** (not facts) and **Experiential Avoidance**. | Loosening the hold of rigid, limiting beliefs and self-stories.                               |

## III. Relational Cycles & Needs Models (What is our pattern?)

These frameworks are essential for mapping the external dynamic between partners,
understanding core relational needs, and predicting cycles.

| Framework                              | Primary Focus                                                                            | Key Utility                                                                   |
| :------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[[Attachment Theory]]**              | **Relational Security/Fear** and predictable bonding styles (Anxious, Avoidant, Secure). | Understanding why certain actions trigger fears of abandonment or engulfment. |
| **[[Nonviolent Communication (NVC)]]** | **Needs & Requests** vs. Demands and Judgments.                                          | Translating complex, emotional conflict into clear, actionable human needs.   |

## IV. Behavior & Change Models (What do I do next?)

These frameworks are used to drive conscious, deliberate change and ensure
accountability.

| Framework                     | Primary Focus                                            | Key Utility                                                                                         |
| :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ACT (Committed Action)**    | **Values** and behavior alignment.                       | Defining the meaningful direction of the relationship and committing to measurable steps toward it. |
| **Gottman Method (Implicit)** | **Relational Skills** (Bids, Repair Attempts, Horsemen). | Providing a vocabulary for specific, observable relational behaviors and their failure states.      |
